# architecture-evolution

Manage architecture changes with impact analysis, ADR generation, and migration planning.

## Triggers

- "evolve architecture"
- "architecture change"
- "add new component"
- "deprecate [component]"
- "migration plan"
- "breaking change"
- "architecture impact"

## Purpose

This skill manages controlled architecture evolution by:
- Analyzing impact of proposed changes
- Generating Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Planning migration paths
- Tracking breaking changes
- Coordinating cross-team dependencies
- Maintaining architecture health

## Behavior

When triggered, this skill:

1. **Identifies change scope**:
   - Parse proposed change
   - Map affected components
   - Identify stakeholders
   - Classify change type

2. **Performs impact analysis**:
   - Direct dependencies
   - Transitive dependencies
   - Data migration needs
   - API compatibility
   - Performance implications

3. **Generates documentation**:
   - Create or update ADR
   - Update component diagrams
   - Document migration path
   - Update API contracts

4. **Plans migration**:
   - Phase-by-phase approach
   - Rollback strategy
   - Feature flags if needed
   - Communication plan

5. **Coordinates execution**:
   - Notify affected teams
   - Track migration progress
   - Validate each phase
   - Confirm completion

```

### Handle Breaking Change

```
User: "Breaking change: new auth token format"

Skill analyzes:
1. Identify all token consumers
2. Plan dual-support period
3. Document migration path

Output:
"Breaking Change Analysis: Auth Token Format

Impact:
- 5 services consume auth tokens
- 2 external API consumers identified
- Mobile apps: iOS 3.2+, Android 4.1+

Migration Strategy:
1. Deploy services with dual-token support
2. Issue new tokens, accept both formats
3. Monitor old token usage decline
4. Set deprecation date (30 days)
5. Remove old token support

Communication Plan:
- Internal teams: Slack + email (immediate)
- External consumers: Email + docs (this week)
- Deprecation notice: 30 days minimum

ADR: .aiwg/architecture/adr-024-token-format.md"
