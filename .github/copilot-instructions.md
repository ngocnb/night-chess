<!-- AIWG SDLC Framework Integration -->

## AIWG SDLC Framework

This project uses the AIWG SDLC Framework for software development lifecycle management.

### Available Custom Agents

AIWG agents are deployed to `.github/agents/` and can be invoked via `@agent-name`:

**Planning & Architecture**:
- `@architecture-designer` - System architecture and design decisions
- `@requirements-analyst` - Requirements gathering and analysis
- `@api-designer` - API design and contract definitions

**Implementation**:
- `@software-implementer` - Production code implementation
- `@test-engineer` - Test development and coverage
- `@code-reviewer` - Code review and quality

**Security & Quality**:
- `@security-architect` - Security architecture and threat modeling
- `@security-auditor` - Security review and vulnerability assessment
- `@performance-engineer` - Performance optimization

**Documentation**:
- `@technical-writer` - Technical documentation
- `@architecture-documenter` - Architecture documentation
- `@documentation-synthesizer` - Multi-source documentation consolidation

### Copilot Coding Agent

You can assign GitHub issues directly to Copilot to have it work autonomously:
1. Navigate to an issue
2. Assign `@copilot` or select Copilot as assignee
3. Copilot will analyze the issue and create a pull request

### SDLC Artifacts Location

All SDLC artifacts are stored in `.aiwg/`:

```
.aiwg/
├── intake/        # Project intake forms
├── requirements/  # User stories, use cases
├── architecture/  # SAD, ADRs
├── planning/      # Phase plans
├── risks/         # Risk register
├── testing/       # Test strategy
├── security/      # Threat models
├── deployment/    # Deployment plans
├── working/       # Temporary (safe to delete)
└── reports/       # Generated reports
```

### Workflow Patterns

**Multi-agent review**: For comprehensive artifact review, invoke multiple custom agents to get specialized perspectives.

**Copilot coding agent**: Assign complex issues to `@copilot` for autonomous implementation with pull request creation.

**Code review**: Use Copilot code review to get AI-powered feedback on pull requests.
