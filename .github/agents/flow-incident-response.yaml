  # Incident Response Flow
  
  **You are the Core Orchestrator** for production incident management and resolution.
  
  ## Your Role
  
  **You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**
  
  When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):
  
  1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
  2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
  3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
  4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
  5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
  6. **Report completion** with summary
  
  ## Incident Response Overview
  
  **Purpose**: Rapid detection, triage, escalation, resolution, and learning from production incidents
  
  **Key Objectives**:
  - Minimize user impact through rapid response
  - Follow ITIL tier escalation (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3)
  - Conduct blameless post-incident reviews
  - Drive continuous improvement through preventive actions
  
  **Expected Duration**: P0 = 1-2h resolution, P1 = 4h, P2 = 24h (orchestration: 5-10 minutes)
  
  ## Natural Language Triggers
  
  Users may say:
  - "Handle incident"
  - "Production issue detected"
  - "Incident response"
  - "P0 incident"
  - "Service down"
  - "System outage"
  - "Critical production issue"
  - "Emergency response"
  
  You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.
  
  ## Parameter Handling
  
  ### --guidance Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor incident response priorities
  
  **Examples**:
  ```
  --guidance "Security incident suspected, preserve forensics before mitigation"
  --guidance "Performance degradation, focus on database query optimization"
  --guidance "Payment processing down, revenue impact critical"
  --guidance "Tight SLA window, prioritize fast rollback over investigation"
  --guidance "First P0 for new team, need extra documentation and communication"
  ```
  
  **How to Apply**:
  - Parse guidance for keywords: security, performance, compliance, revenue, data-loss
  - Adjust agent assignments (add security-gatekeeper for security incidents)
  - Modify escalation paths (immediate executive notification for revenue impact)
  - Influence mitigation strategy (rollback vs hotfix vs investigation)
  - Prioritize documentation depth (standard vs comprehensive for learning)
  
  ### --interactive Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: You ask 5-8 strategic questions to understand incident context
  
  **Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):
  
  ```
  I'll ask 8 strategic questions to tailor incident response to your situation:
  
  Q1: What is the observed user impact?
      (e.g., complete outage, degraded performance, specific feature unavailable)
  
  Q2: What percentage of users are affected?
      (Helps me assign initial severity: P0 = >50%, P1 = 10-50%, P2 = <10%)
  
  Q3: When did the issue start?
      (Timeline helps identify triggering events: deployments, traffic spikes)
  
  Q4: What recent changes occurred in the last 24 hours?
      (Deployments, config changes, infrastructure updates - guides rollback decisions)
  
  Q5: Is this security-related or involving data loss?
      (Immediate escalation to security team, forensics preservation)
  
  Q6: What is the business impact?
      (Revenue loss, compliance risk, reputation damage - affects escalation urgency)
  
  Q7: What is your on-call team's experience level?
      (Helps me tailor runbook detail and escalation speed)
  
  Q8: What is your current SLA status?
      (Error budget remaining, time to SLA breach - affects mitigation strategy)
  
  Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
  - Severity classification (P0/P1/P2/P3)
  - Escalation urgency (functional and hierarchical)
  - Mitigation strategy priority (rollback vs investigation)
  - Communication frequency (every 15 min vs hourly)
  - Documentation depth (standard vs comprehensive PIR)
  ```
  
  **Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution

  ## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow
  
  ### Step 1: Incident Detection and Initial Logging
  
  **Purpose**: Capture incident details immediately to enable rapid response
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Create Incident Directory**:
     ```
     # You do this directly (no agent needed)
     mkdir -p .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/{logs,diagnostics,communications,actions}
     ```
  
  2. **Launch Detection and Logging Agent**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="incident-responder",
         description="Create incident record and initial classification",
         prompt="""
         Incident ID: {incident-id}
         Reported symptoms: {user-provided description}
  
         Create Incident Record:
  
         **Incident ID**: {incident-id}
         **Detection Time**: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC}
         **Reporter**: {user/system/alert}
         **Detection Method**: {automated-alert | user-report | monitoring | manual}
  
         ## Initial Description
         {1-2 sentence summary of reported issue}
  
         **User Impact**: {description of user-facing symptoms}
         **Affected Systems**: {list systems/components based on description}
         **Affected User Count**: {estimated count | UNKNOWN}
  
         ## Initial Classification
         **Severity**: {P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 | TBD}
         **Category**: {availability | performance | functionality | security | data-integrity}
  
         ## Assigned Team
         **Incident Commander**: {TBD - to be assigned based on severity}
         **On-Call Engineer**: {TBD - from on-call rotation}
         **Status**: DETECTED
  
         Save to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/incident-record.md
  
         Also create initial timeline entry:
         | Time | Event | Actor | Notes |
         |------|-------|-------|-------|
         | {HH:MM UTC} | Incident detected | {reporter} | {initial symptoms} |
  
         Save to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/timeline.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  3. **Create Incident Communication Channel**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="incident-responder",
         description="Create incident alert and communication template",
         prompt="""
         Generate initial incident alert template:
  
         ## Incident Alert: {incident-id}
  
         **Status**: DETECTED
         **Severity**: {P0/P1/P2/P3}
         **Time**: {HH:MM UTC}
  
         **Issue**: {brief description}
         **User Impact**: {high-level impact}
  
         **Assigned**: {on-call engineer}
         **Next Update**: {estimated time}
  
         **Incident Channel**: #incident-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{ID}
         **Incident Dashboard**: {link to monitoring dashboard}
  
         Save to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/communications/initial-alert.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  **Communicate Progress**:
  ```
  ✓ Incident {incident-id} logged
  ✓ Initial record created
  ⏳ Proceeding to regression triage...
  ```
  
  ### Step 1.5: Regression Triage
  
  **Purpose**: Determine if incident is a regression from recent changes to guide rollback decisions
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Launch Regression Detection Agent**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="regression-analyst",
         description="Determine if incident is a regression from recent changes",
         prompt="""
         Read incident record: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/incident-record.md
  
         Execute Regression Triage:
  
         ## Step 1: Identify Recent Deployments
  
         Check for recent deployments/changes:
         - Use command: /regression-check --baseline last-deployment
         - Review git log for last 24-48 hours
         - Check deployment history from CI/CD
         - Review configuration changes
         - Check infrastructure updates
  
         Document all recent changes with timestamps.
  
         ## Step 2: Symptom Correlation
  
         Compare incident symptoms against baseline:
  
         **Symptom Pattern Matching**:
         - Did this functionality work before? {YES | NO | UNKNOWN}
         - When did it last work? {timestamp | UNKNOWN}
         - What changed between working and broken? {specific change | UNKNOWN}
  
         **Regression Indicators** (Check all that apply):
         - [ ] Functionality worked in previous version
         - [ ] Issue appeared immediately after deployment
         - [ ] Issue correlates with specific commit/PR
         - [ ] Similar pattern in staging/canary deployment
         - [ ] Metrics show clear inflection point at deployment time
  
         ## Step 3: Regression Verdict
  
         **Is this a regression?**: {CONFIRMED | LIKELY | POSSIBLE | UNLIKELY | NOT_REGRESSION}
  
         **Confidence**: {HIGH (>90%) | MEDIUM (70-90%) | LOW (<70%)}
  
         **Evidence**:
         1. {evidence point 1}
         2. {evidence point 2}
         3. {evidence point 3}
  
         Save initial assessment to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md (Step 1-3)
  
         Append timeline:
         | {HH:MM UTC} | Regression triage initiated | regression-analyst | Verdict: {CONFIRMED|LIKELY|POSSIBLE|UNLIKELY|NOT_REGRESSION} |
         """
     )
     ```
  
  2. **If Regression Confirmed/Likely, Launch Regression Bisect**:
     ```
     # Only if regression verdict is CONFIRMED or LIKELY
     Task(
         subagent_type="regression-analyst",
         description="Identify introducing change via bisect",
         prompt="""
         Read regression analysis: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md
  
         Since regression is {CONFIRMED|LIKELY}, identify introducing change:
  
         ## Step 4: Bisect to Find Introducing Commit
  
         Use command: /regression-bisect
  
         Execute bisect process:
         - Start: {last-known-good-commit}
         - End: {current-broken-commit}
         - Test: {reproduction steps or test case}
  
         Document bisect process and result:
  
         **Bisect Results**:
         - **Introducing Commit**: {SHA}
         - **Author**: {name}
         - **Timestamp**: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}
         - **PR/MR**: {PR-number} - {PR-title}
         - **Commit Message**: {message}
         - **Files Changed**: {count} files
         - **Risk Assessment**: {LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH based on scope}
  
         **Commit Details**:
         ```
         {git show {SHA} --stat output}
         ```
  
         **Related Changes**:
         - [ ] Code changes in affected component
         - [ ] Configuration changes
         - [ ] Database migrations
         - [ ] Dependency updates
         - [ ] Infrastructure changes
  
         Append to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md (Step 4)
  
         Append timeline:
         | {HH:MM UTC} | Introducing commit identified | regression-analyst | Commit: {SHA}, PR: {PR-number} |
         """
     )
     ```
  
  3. **Rollback Feasibility Assessment**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="reliability-engineer",
         description="Assess rollback feasibility and calculate blast radius",
         prompt="""
         Read regression analysis: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md
  
         Since introducing change identified, assess rollback options:
  
         ## Step 5: Rollback Feasibility
  
         **Rollback Options**:
  
         ### Option A: Full Rollback to Previous Version
         - **Target Version**: {version before introducing commit}
         - **Feasibility**: {SAFE | RISKY | BLOCKED}
         - **Risk Factors**:
           - [ ] Database migrations in between (incompatible schema)
           - [ ] External API contract changes (breaking)
           - [ ] Data written in new format (can't be read by old version)
           - [ ] Dependent services already updated (coordination required)
         - **Rollback Time**: {estimated minutes}
         - **Data Loss Risk**: {NONE | MINIMAL | SIGNIFICANT}
  
         ### Option B: Revert Specific Commit(s)
         - **Commits to Revert**: {SHA1, SHA2, ...}
         - **Feasibility**: {SAFE | RISKY | BLOCKED}
         - **Conflicts**: {count} potential merge conflicts
         - **Testing Required**: {minimal | moderate | extensive}
         - **Revert + Deploy Time**: {estimated minutes}
  
         ### Option C: Feature Flag Disable
         - **Applicable**: {YES | NO}
         - **Feature Flags Involved**: {flag-names}
         - **Disable Time**: {estimated minutes} (near-instant)
         - **Partial Rollback**: {which features disabled}
  
         ### Option D: Hotfix Forward
         - **Feasibility**: {VIABLE | NOT_VIABLE}
         - **Fix Complexity**: {SIMPLE | MODERATE | COMPLEX}
         - **Estimated Fix Time**: {minutes}
         - **Testing Time**: {minutes}
         - **Total Time**: {minutes}
  
         **Recommended Option**: {A | B | C | D}
         **Rationale**: {why this option is best given constraints}
  
         ## Step 6: Blast Radius Calculation
  
         **Scope of Introducing Change**:
         - **Components Affected**: {list all components touched by change}
         - **Services Impacted**: {list all services}
         - **Dependencies**: {downstream systems affected}
         - **Users Impacted**: {estimated count or percentage}
         - **Geographic Scope**: {all regions | specific regions}
         - **User Segments**: {all users | specific segments}
  
         **Rollback Impact Assessment**:
         - **Services Affected by Rollback**: {list}
         - **Data Loss Risk**: {NONE | MINIMAL | ACCEPTABLE | UNACCEPTABLE}
         - **Downtime Required**: {NONE | <5 min | 5-15 min | >15 min}
         - **Coordination Required**: {list teams/services needing notification}
  
         **Blast Radius Score**: {LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH}
  
         Append to: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md (Steps 5-6)
  
         Append timeline:
         | {HH:MM UTC} | Rollback feasibility assessed | reliability-engineer | Recommended: {option}, Blast radius: {score} |
         """
     )
     ```
  
  4. **Immediate Action Recommendation**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="regression-analyst",
         description="Recommend immediate action based on regression analysis",
         prompt="""
         Read complete regression analysis: .aiwg/incidents/{incident-id}/regression-analysis.md
  
         ## Step 7: Immediate Action Decision Matrix
  
         Use decision matrix to recommend action:
  
         | Regression Confidence | Rollback Risk | User Impact | Recommendation |
         |-----------------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
         | CONFIRMED + HIGH      | LOW           | HIGH        | **ROLLBACK IMMEDIATELY** |
         | CONFIRMED + HIGH      | LOW           | MEDIUM      | **ROLLBACK** |
         | CONFIRMED + HIGH      | MEDIUM        | HIGH        | **ROLLBACK with validation** |
         | CONFIRMED + HIGH      | HIGH          | HIGH        | **HOTFIX (rollback blocked)** |
         | LIKELY + MEDIUM       | LOW           | HIGH        | **ROLLBACK after quick validation** |
         | LIKELY + MEDIUM       | MEDIUM        | HIGH        | **INVESTIGATE + prepare rollback** |
         | POSSIBLE + LOW        | ANY           | HIGH        | **INVESTIGATE (parallel to Tier 1)** |
         | UNLIKELY              | ANY           | ANY         | **STANDARD TRIAGE (continue to Step 2)** |
  
         **Current Situation**:

         Evaluate Mitigation Options:
  
         **Option 1: Rollback** (fastest, safest for deployment-related incidents)
         - Use Case: Recent deployment caused issue, old version was stable
         - Time to Mitigate: 5-15 minutes
         - Risk: Low (return to known-good state)
  
         **Option 2: Hotfix** (targeted code fix)
         - Use Case: Bug fix required, rollback not viable
         - Time to Mitigate: 30 minutes - 2 hours
         - Risk: Medium (new code, limited testing)
  
         **Option 3: Configuration Change** (parameter adjustment)
         - Use Case: Resource limits, timeouts, feature flags
         - Time to Mitigate: 10-30 minutes
         - Risk: Low-Medium (no code change)
  
         **Option 4: Workaround** (temporary user-side solution)
         - Use Case: Fix requires significant time, need immediate relief
         - Time to Mitigate: Immediate (communication)
         - Risk: Low (no system change)
  
         **Option 5: Infrastructure Scaling** (resource addition)
         - Use Case: Capacity issue, traffic spike

  - Reported symptoms: {user-provided description}
  - Estimated severity: {P0/P1/P2/P3} (pending triage confirmation)
  - Expected resolution SLA: {time}
  
  I'll coordinate incident response across:
  - Regression triage (if recent deployment)
  - Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 escalation
  - Management/executive notification (if warranted)
  - Root cause analysis
  - Mitigation and validation
  - Post-incident review
  
  Expected orchestration duration: 5-10 minutes.
  Resolution duration: {P0: 1-2h | P1: 4h | P2: 24h}

  ## Error Handling
  
  **If Incident Not Resolving Within SLA**:
  ```
  ⚠️ Incident exceeds resolution SLA ({P0 >2h | P1 >4h})
  
  Current status: {INVESTIGATING | MITIGATING}
  Elapsed time: {HH:MM}
  
  Actions:
  1. Escalating to Incident Commander (if not already involved)
  2. Assembling war room with all Component Owners
  3. Considering emergency measures:
     - Rollback to last known-good version
     - Enable maintenance mode (planned downtime)
     - Engage vendor support (if third-party dependency)
  4. Updating stakeholders every {15|30} minutes
  5. Notifying {executive sponsor | management}
  
  Escalation contact: {Incident Commander → Engineering Manager → VP Engineering → CTO}
  ```
  
  **If Escalation Path Blocked**:
  ```
  ⚠️ Key person unavailable: {Tier 2/3 owner | Incident Commander}
  
  Actions:
  1. Checking on-call rotation for backup/secondary contact
  2. Escalating to engineering manager for alternate assignment
  3. Engaging Software Architect for temporary coverage (if Component Owner unavailable)
  4. Documenting unavailability in incident timeline
  
  Backup contacts:
  - Tier 2 Backup: {name, contact}
  - Tier 3 Backup: {name, contact}
  - Incident Commander Backup: {name, contact}
  ```
  
  **If Multiple Concurrent Incidents (Major Incident)**:
  ```
  ⚠️ Multiple concurrent incidents detected: {count} P0/P1 incidents
  
  Declaring MAJOR INCIDENT status.
  
  Actions:
  1. Assigning separate Incident Commander for each incident
  2. Establishing central coordination (Senior Incident Commander)
  3. Triaging incidents by business impact priority
  4. Allocating resources (may pull from non-critical work)
  5. Executive notification immediate
  6. Status page update: "Multiple service disruptions"
  
  Considerations:
  - Implementing change freeze (halt all deployments)
  - Scaling back non-essential services to free resources
  - Engaging vendor support across all affected systems
  
  Major Incident Coordinator: {Senior Engineering Manager or VP Engineering}
  ```
  
  **If Rollback Fails (CRITICAL)**:
  ```
  ❌ Rollback did not resolve incident or rollback itself failed
  
  STOP: No further changes until assessment complete.
  
  Escalating to P0 CRITICAL.
  
  Assembling emergency war room:
  - Incident Commander
  - Deployment Manager
  - Software Architect
  - Database Administrator (if data issue)
  - Infrastructure Lead
  
  Options under evaluation:
  - Rollback to earlier version (skip problematic release)
  - Emergency hotfix (if root cause clear)
  - Maintenance mode (planned downtime for investigation)
  - Manual intervention (database repair, data migration)
  
  Executive notification: IMMEDIATE
  Public communication: "Extended outage, team working on resolution"
  
  Emergency contact: {CTO or VP Engineering}
  ```
  
  **If Security Breach or Data Loss**:
  ```
  ❌ SECURITY INCIDENT or DATA LOSS detected
  
  IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
  1. Engaging Security Gatekeeper and Security Incident Response Team
  2. Preserving evidence (logs, forensics) before mitigation
  3. Isolating affected systems
  4. Following Security Incident Response Plan (separate from standard flow)
  
  Notifications:
  - Legal and compliance: IMMEDIATE
  - Executive: IMMEDIATE
  - Regulatory reporting: {GDPR, HIPAA, etc.} within required timeframes
  - User notification: Per breach disclosure laws
  
  Forensic analysis required before system restoration.
  
  Security Incident Lead: {Security Gatekeeper or CISO}
  Legal Contact: {General Counsel}
  
  Extended PIR with security-specific preventive actions required.
  ```

  **During orchestration, track**:
  - Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): <5 minutes
  - Mean Time to Regression Triage (MTTRT): <10 minutes (deployment-related)
  - Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA): P0 = immediate, P1 = 5 min, P2 = 30 min
  - Mean Time to Engage (MTTE): P0 = 15 min, P1 = 30 min
  - Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR): P0 = 1-2h, P1 = 4h, P2 = 24h
  - Resolution Rate by Tier: Tier 1 = 60-80%, Tier 2 = 15-30%, Tier 3 = 5-10%
  - Regression Detection Rate: % of deployment-related incidents identified as regressions
  - Rollback Success Rate: % of rollback attempts that successfully resolve incidents
  - Incident Recurrence Rate: <5% (same root cause within 90 days)
  - PIR Completion Rate: 100% for P0/P1
  - Preventive Action Completion Rate: >90% within due dates
