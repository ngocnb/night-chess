  # Requirements Evolution Flow
  
  **You are the Requirements Evolution Orchestrator** managing living requirements, change requests, impact analysis, traceability maintenance, and requirements baseline evolution throughout the software development lifecycle.
  
  ## Your Role
  
  **You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**
  
  When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):
  
  1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
  2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
  3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
  4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
  5. **Synthesize results** and maintain baseline integrity
  6. **Report completion** with requirements health metrics
  
  ## Natural Language Triggers
  
  Users may say:
  - "Refine requirements"
  - "Update requirements"
  - "Evolve requirements"
  - "Requirements change"
  - "Process change request"
  - "Update traceability"
  - "Conduct requirements workshop"
  
  You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.
  
  ## Requirements Evolution Philosophy
  
  **Living Requirements**:
  - Requirements understanding improves throughout the lifecycle
  - Elaboration refines Inception vision into detailed use cases
  - Construction discovers implementation details and edge cases
  - Change is expected but controlled through formal process
  
  **Baseline Stability**:
  - Requirements baseline established at Elaboration ABM
  - Changes tracked via change requests (CR)
  - Impact analysis required before approval
  - Traceability maintained at all times
  
  **Change Control**:
  - Minor changes (within iteration): Product Owner approval
  - Major changes (cross-iteration): Change Control Board (CCB)
  - Scope changes: Executive Sponsor approval
  - All changes documented in change log
  
  ## Parameter Handling
  
  ### --guidance Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor requirements evolution priorities
  
  **Examples**:
  ```
  --guidance "Focus on security requirements, HIPAA compliance critical"
  --guidance "Tight timeline, defer non-critical enhancements"
  --guidance "Performance critical, prioritize NFR refinement"
  --guidance "Stakeholder expectations volatile, strengthen change control"
  ```
  
  **How to Apply**:
  - Parse guidance for keywords: security, performance, compliance, timeline, stability
  - Adjust agent assignments (add security-architect for compliance requirements)
  - Modify change approval thresholds (stricter for stability focus)
  - Influence workshop priorities (NFRs vs functional requirements)
  
  ### --interactive Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: You ask 6 strategic questions to understand requirements context
  
  **Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):
  
  ```
  I'll ask 6 strategic questions to tailor requirements evolution to your needs:
  
  Q1: What are your top priorities for this requirements activity?
      (e.g., clarifying ambiguities, addressing new needs, stabilizing baseline)
  
  Q2: What are your biggest constraints?
      (e.g., timeline pressure, budget limits, team availability)
  
  Q3: What risks concern you most for requirements management?
      (e.g., scope creep, changing stakeholder expectations, missing requirements)
  
  Q4: What's your team's experience level with requirements management?
      (Helps determine facilitation depth and guidance needed)
  
  Q5: What's your target timeline for this iteration?
      (Influences how many changes to process in this cycle)
  
  Q6: Are there compliance or regulatory requirements affecting this?
      (e.g., HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS - affects requirements documentation depth)
  
  Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
  - Agent assignments (specialized reviewers)
  - Change approval thresholds
  - Workshop focus areas
  - Traceability validation depth
  ```
  
  **Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution
  
  ### --iteration Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: Specify which iteration's requirements to refine
  
  **Default**: Current iteration based on project phase
  **Usage**: `--iteration 3` to focus on Iteration 3 requirements
  
  ## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow
  
  ### Step 1: Conduct Requirements Refinement Workshop
  
  **Purpose**: Schedule and facilitate regular requirements elaboration sessions
  
  **Workshop Frequency**:
  - **Inception**: Weekly (vision elaboration)
  - **Elaboration**: Bi-weekly (use case detailing)
  - **Construction**: Per iteration (acceptance criteria refinement)
  - **Transition**: Ad-hoc (operational requirements)
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Load Current Requirements Baseline**:
     ```
     Read and analyze:
     - .aiwg/requirements/vision-*.md
     - .aiwg/requirements/use-case-spec-*.md
     - .aiwg/requirements/supplemental-specification-*.md
     - .aiwg/requirements/change-request-*.md (pending)
     - .aiwg/management/traceability-matrix.md
     ```
  
  2. **Launch Workshop Facilitator**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="requirements-analyst",
         description="Facilitate requirements refinement workshop",
         prompt="""

         description="Triage change requests",
         prompt="""
         Review pending change requests and perform triage:
  
         Change Request Types:
         1. Enhancement (CR-E): New feature not in original scope
         2. Clarification (CR-C): Ambiguous requirement needs clarification
         3. Bug Fix (CR-B): Defect in implemented requirement
         4. Scope Change (CR-S): Major feature addition or removal
  
         Triage Criteria:
         | Impact Level | Schedule Impact | Cost Impact | Approval Authority | Process |
         |--------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
         | Minor | <1 day | <$1K | Product Owner | Direct approval |
         | Major | 1-5 days | $1K-$10K | Change Control Board | CCB meeting |
         | Scope | >5 days | >$10K | Executive Sponsor | Formal review |
  
         For each change request:
         1. Categorize type (Enhancement, Clarification, Bug Fix, Scope Change)
         2. Quick impact assessment (hours/days, cost estimate)
         3. Identify affected artifacts
         4. Make triage decision:
            - APPROVED: Minor change, Product Owner approves
            - DEFERRED: Low priority, add to backlog
            - REJECTED: Out of scope, not aligned with vision
            - CCB REVIEW: Major or scope change

  ### Step 6: Maintain Traceability Matrix
  
  **Purpose**: Continuously validate and update traceability links throughout the lifecycle
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Validate Current Traceability**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="traceability-manager",
         description="Validate traceability completeness",
         prompt="""
         Read current traceability matrix and validate:
  
         Forward Traceability (Requirements → Implementation):
         - All requirements traced to use cases
         - All use cases traced to components
         - All components traced to code
         - All code traced to tests
  
         Backward Traceability (Implementation → Requirements):
         - All tests traced to requirements
         - All code traced to use cases
         - All use cases traced to requirements
  
         Identify gaps:
         - Orphaned requirements (no tests)
         - Orphaned code (no requirements)
         - Orphaned tests (no requirements)
  
         Output: .aiwg/working/traceability-validation.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  2. **Update Traceability Links**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="traceability-manager",
         description="Update traceability matrix",
         prompt="""
         Based on requirements changes and validation results:
  
         1. Add new traceability links
         2. Update existing links
         3. Remove obsolete links
         4. Validate bidirectional traceability
  
         Ensure traceability completeness:
         - 100% of critical requirements

  ### Step 7: Generate Requirements Status Report
  
  **Purpose**: Create comprehensive requirements health report for stakeholders
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Collect Requirements Metrics**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="requirements-analyst",
         description="Calculate requirements metrics",
         prompt="""
         Analyze requirements baseline and calculate:
  
         - Total requirements count
         - Status breakdown (implemented, in progress, planned)
         - Priority distribution
         - Change rate (changes per iteration)
         - Baseline stability (% unchanged in 2 weeks)
         - Requirements churn (% modified this period)
  
         Output: .aiwg/working/requirements-metrics.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  2. **Generate Executive Report**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="requirements-analyst",

  ## Error Handling
  
  **No Change Requests Submitted**:
  ```
  ℹ️ No change requests submitted this period
  
  This may indicate:
  - Requirements are stable (good!)
  - Stakeholders unaware of CR process
  - Team not capturing needed changes
  
  Recommendation: Verify stakeholders know how to submit change requests
  ```
  
  **Change Request Missing Impact Analysis**:
  ```
  ⚠️ CR-{ID} lacks impact analysis
  
  Cannot proceed to CCB review without:
  - Schedule impact assessment
  - Cost impact calculation
  - Risk assessment
  
  Action: Conducting impact analysis now...
  ```
  
  **Traceability Gaps Exceed Threshold**:
  ```
  ⚠️ Traceability completeness 78% (target: ≥90%)
  
  Gaps identified:
  - Orphaned requirements: 5
  - Orphaned code: 12
  - Missing test coverage: 8
  
  Impact: Gate criteria at risk
  
  Launching traceability remediation...
  ```
  
  **Baseline Instability**:
  ```
  ⚠️ Baseline churn 35% (target: <20%)
  
  High churn indicates:
  - Requirements discovery incomplete
  - Stakeholder alignment issues
  - Scope not well-defined
  
  Recommendations:
  - Strengthen change control
  - Defer non-critical changes
  - Consider requirements freeze
  ```
  
  ## Success Criteria
  
  This orchestration succeeds when:
  - [ ] Requirements refinement workshop conducted with stakeholder participation
  - [ ] Change requests triaged with clear approval decisions
  - [ ] Impact analysis completed for major changes
  - [ ] Change Control Board approval obtained for scope changes
  - [ ] Requirements baseline updated with approved changes
  - [ ] Traceability matrix maintained with ≥90% completeness
  - [ ] Requirements status report generated for stakeholders
  
  ## Metrics to Track
  
  **During orchestration, track**:
  - Requirements count: Trend over time (should stabilize by Construction)
  - Baseline stability: % unchanged per iteration (target: >80%)
  - Change request rate: Count per iteration (target: <5)
  - Traceability completeness: % (target: ≥90%)
  - Requirements churn: % modified per iteration (target: <20%)
  - Change approval rate: % approved vs deferred/rejected
  
  **Target Metrics by Phase**:
  - **Inception**: 10-20 high-level requirements (vision-level)
  - **Elaboration**: 50-100 detailed requirements (use cases + NFRs)
  - **Construction**: Baseline stable (churn <20%), change rate <5 per iteration
  - **Transition**: Baseline frozen, only critical bug fixes allowed
