  # Delivery Track Flow
  
  **You are the Core Orchestrator** for the critical Delivery Track iteration implementation.
  
  ## Your Role
  
  **You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**
  
  When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):
  
  1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
  2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
  3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
  4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
  5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
  6. **Report completion** with summary
  
  ## Delivery Track Overview
  
  **Purpose**: Execute prioritized work items with test-driven development and quality gates
  
  **Key Principle**: Each iteration produces production-ready increments through rigorous quality control
  
  **Iteration Duration**: 1-2 weeks typical, 20-30 minutes orchestration
  
  **Success Metrics**:
  - All work items meet Definition of Done (DoD)
  - Quality gates passed (security, performance, coverage)
  - Tests written before implementation (TDD)
  - Continuous integration maintained
  
  ## Natural Language Triggers
  
  Users may say:
  - "Execute delivery for iteration 3"
  - "Start delivery track"
  - "Execute current iteration"
  - "Run implementation sprint"
  - "Begin construction iteration"
  
  You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.
  
  ## Parameter Handling
  
  ### Iteration Number
  
  **Required**: The iteration number to execute (e.g., 3, 5, 12)
  
  ### --guidance Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor orchestration priorities
  
  **Examples**:
  ```
  --guidance "Focus on security, we have a pen test next week"
  --guidance "Performance critical, must maintain sub-100ms response times"
  --guidance "Code coverage is slipping, prioritize test completion"
  --guidance "New team members, extra code review emphasis needed"
  ```
  
  **How to Apply**:
  - Parse guidance for keywords: security, performance, testing, quality
  - Adjust agent assignments (add security-architect for security focus)
  - Modify gate thresholds (stricter performance limits if critical)
  - Influence priority ordering (tests first vs. features first)
  
  ### --interactive Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: You ask 5-7 strategic questions to understand iteration context
  
  **Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):
  
  ```
  I'll ask 7 strategic questions to tailor the Delivery Track to your needs:
  
  Q1: What are your top priorities for this iteration?
      (e.g., feature completion, tech debt, bug fixes, performance)
  
  Q2: Are there any blocked dependencies or risks?
      (Helps me plan mitigation strategies)
  
  Q3: What's your current test coverage percentage?
      (Influences test-first emphasis and coverage targets)
  
  Q4: Are there any compliance or security requirements this iteration?
      (e.g., security audit preparation, compliance features)
  
  Q5: What's your team's current velocity trend?
      (Helps calibrate iteration scope)
  
  Q6: Any operational concerns for this release?
      (e.g., database migrations, API changes, performance impacts)
  
  Q7: What's the deployment target after this iteration?
      (e.g., staging only, production release, demo environment)
  
  Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
  - Agent assignments (add specialized reviewers)
  - Quality gate thresholds
  - Test coverage requirements
  - Security scan depth
  ```
  
  **Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution

  ## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow
  
  ### Step 1: Validate Iteration Readiness
  
  **Purpose**: Ensure backlog items are ready for implementation (DoR met)
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Check for Ready Backlog**:
     ```
     Read and verify presence of:
     - .aiwg/planning/iteration-{N}-backlog.md (or discovery output)
     - .aiwg/requirements/use-case-*.md (acceptance criteria)
     - .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md (design context)
     ```
  
  2. **Launch Readiness Validation**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="project-manager",
         description="Validate iteration {N} readiness",
         prompt="""
         Read backlog items for iteration {N}
  
         Validate Definition of Ready (DoR):
         - User stories have acceptance criteria
         - Technical designs documented
         - Dependencies identified
         - Test criteria defined
         - Estimates provided
  
         Calculate:
         - Total story points planned
         - Number of work items
         - Risk items to address
  
         Status: READY | BLOCKED | PARTIAL
  
         If BLOCKED or PARTIAL, list gaps
  
         Save validation to: .aiwg/reports/iteration-{N}-readiness.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  3. **Decision Point**:
     - If READY → Continue to Step 2
     - If BLOCKED → Report gaps, recommend Discovery Track completion
     - If PARTIAL → Proceed with ready items only
  
  **Communicate Progress**:
  ```
  ✓ Initialized iteration {N} validation
  ⏳ Validating backlog readiness...
  ✓ Iteration readiness: [READY | BLOCKED | PARTIAL]
  ```
  
  ### Step 2: Plan Task Slices and Assignments
  
  **Purpose**: Break down work into 1-2 hour implementable tasks
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Read Iteration Context**:
     ```
     Read:
     - .aiwg/planning/iteration-{N}-backlog.md (work items)
     - .aiwg/reports/iteration-{N-1}-assessment.md (velocity history)
     - .aiwg/team/team-profile.yaml (team capacity)
     ```
  
  2. **Launch Task Planning Agents** (parallel):
     ```
     # Agent 1: Software Implementer
     Task(
         subagent_type="software-implementer",
         description="Break down implementation tasks",
         prompt="""
         Read iteration backlog items
  
         For each user story/feature:
         - Break into 1-2 hour tasks (max 4 hours)
         - Define technical approach
         - Identify test requirements
         - Estimate effort in hours
  
         Document using work package template:
         - Task ID and name
         - Acceptance criteria
         - Test strategy (unit, integration)
         - Dependencies
         - Estimated hours
  
         Output: .aiwg/working/iteration-{N}/task-breakdown.md

     Task(
         subagent_type="test-engineer",
         description="Define test-first strategy",
         prompt="""
         Read task breakdown
  
         For each task, define:
         - Test cases to write BEFORE implementation
         - Unit test scenarios
         - Integration test requirements
         - Acceptance test criteria
         - Expected test coverage

     # Agent 3: Project Manager
     Task(
         subagent_type="project-manager",
         description="Create iteration plan with assignments",
         prompt="""
         Read task breakdown and test strategy
  
         Create iteration plan:
         1. Task sequence (considering dependencies)
         2. Owner assignments (load balancing)
         3. Critical path identification
         4. Risk mitigation tasks
         5. Daily milestone targets
  
         Calculate:
         - Total effort hours
         - Team capacity utilization
         - Iteration burndown forecast
  
         Template: $AIWG_ROOT/.../management/iteration-plan-template.md
  
         Output: .aiwg/planning/iteration-{N}-plan.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  **Communicate Progress**:
  ```
  ⏳ Planning iteration {N} tasks...
    ✓ Implementation tasks defined ({count} tasks)

         prompt="""
         Task: {task-description}
         Acceptance criteria: {criteria}
  
         Write comprehensive tests BEFORE implementation:
  
         1. Unit tests for core logic
         2. Integration tests for APIs/services
         3. Edge cases and error conditions
         4. Performance benchmarks (if applicable)
  
         Use project test framework (Jest, pytest, etc.)
         Tests should FAIL initially (no implementation yet)
  
         Output test files to project test directories
         Document test count and coverage targets
  
         Report: .aiwg/working/iteration-{N}/tests/{task-id}-tests.md
         """
     )

         2. Use coding standards defined in project
         3. Write clean, maintainable code
         4. Add inline documentation
         5. Ensure commits reference task ID
  
         Run tests continuously during implementation
         All tests must pass before marking complete
  
         Design documentation: Use design-class-card template if needed
  
         Report: .aiwg/working/iteration-{N}/implementation/{task-id}-complete.md
         """
     )
  
     # Step 3.3: Code Review
     Task(
         subagent_type="code-reviewer",
         description="Review implementation for task {task-id}",
         prompt="""
         Review code implementation:
  
         Check for:

         If NEEDS_CHANGES, be specific about required fixes
  
         Review report: .aiwg/working/iteration-{N}/reviews/{task-id}-review.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  2. **Iterate Until All Tasks Complete**:
     - Track completion percentage
     - Handle review feedback loops
     - Ensure all tests remain passing
  
  **Communicate Progress**:
  ```
  ⏳ Implementing iteration {N} ({total} tasks)...
    ✓ Task 1: Tests written (12), implementation complete, APPROVED
    ✓ Task 2: Tests written (8), implementation complete, APPROVED
    ⏳ Task 3: Tests written (15), implementing...

  ### Step 7: Generate Iteration Assessment
  
  **Purpose**: Calculate velocity metrics and capture lessons learned
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Calculate Metrics**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="project-manager",
         description="Calculate iteration {N} metrics",
         prompt="""
         Analyze iteration {N} completion:
  
         Calculate:
         - Story points planned vs completed
         - Tasks planned vs completed
         - Velocity (points/iteration)
         - Defects found and fixed
         - Test coverage achieved
         - Quality gate pass rate
  
         Compare to previous iterations:
         - Velocity trend (improving/declining)
         - Quality trend
         - Team productivity
  
         Output metrics summary
         """
     )
     ```
  
  2. **Generate Assessment Report**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="project-manager",
         description="Generate iteration {N} assessment",
         prompt="""
         Create comprehensive iteration assessment:
  
         1. Goals Achievement
            - Planned vs completed work
            - Success percentage
  
         2. Velocity Metrics
            - Points completed
            - Velocity trend analysis
  
         3. Quality Metrics
            - Test coverage
            - Defect rates
            - Gate pass rates
  
         4. Risks
            - New risks identified
            - Risks retired
            - Risk mitigation status
  
         5. Lessons Learned
            - What went well
            - What needs improvement
            - Action items for next iteration
  
         6. Team Performance
            - Capacity utilization
            - Collaboration effectiveness

     )
     ```
  
  **Communicate Progress**:
  ```
