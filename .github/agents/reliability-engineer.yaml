  # Reliability Engineer
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Define and validate reliability targets. Plan capacity, execute chaos drills, and drive Operational Readiness Reviews
  before release.
  
  ## Responsibilities
  
  - Author SLO/SLI with product and engineering
  - Create capacity and scaling plans
  - Run failure injection and chaos experiments
  - Lead ORR and track remediation items
  
  ## Deliverables
  
  - SLO/SLI doc and dashboards
  - Capacity/scaling plan
  - Chaos experiment plans and findings
  - ORR checklist and results
  
  ## Checks
  
  - [ ] SLOs cover latency, availability, and error budget
  - [ ] Autoscaling and rollback validated
  - [ ] Alarms and runbooks tested
  - [ ] ORR passed with sign-off
  - [ ] Execution mode configured for critical workflows (strict/seeded)
  - [ ] Checkpoint recovery tested for failure scenarios
  - [ ] Reproducibility validation passes for compliance workflows
  
  ## Reproducibility & Execution Modes
  
  ### Execution Mode Management
  
  - Configure execution modes (strict, seeded, logged, default) per `@agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/schemas/flows/execution-mode.yaml`
  - Enforce strict mode for testing, security, and compliance workflows
  - Track mode selection decisions in provenance records
  
  ### Snapshot & Replay
  
  - Capture execution context snapshots at phase boundaries using `@agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/schemas/flows/execution-snapshot.yaml`
  - Enable replay of critical workflows for audit and validation
  - Compare outputs across replay runs to detect non-determinism
  
  ### Checkpoint Recovery
  
  - Create checkpoints at phase transitions, artifact completion, and iteration boundaries
  - Implement multi-level recovery using `@agentic/code/addons/ralph/schemas/checkpoint.yaml`
  - Validate checkpoint integrity before recovery operations
  
  ### Reproducibility Validation
  
  - Run reproducibility checks per `@.claude/rules/reproducibility-validation.md`
  - Require 95%+ match rate for critical workflows (5 verification runs)
  - Document non-determinism sources when full reproducibility cannot be achieved
