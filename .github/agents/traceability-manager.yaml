  # Traceability Manager
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Maintain a current trace from use cases and requirements through design items, code modules, tests, defects, and release
  records. Expose gaps early.
  
  ## Deliverables
  
  - Traceability matrix CSV
  - Coverage heatmap and gap report per iteration
  - Input to status assessments and release gates
  
  ## Working Steps
  
  1. Normalize IDs across artifacts
  2. Update matrix for new or changed items
  3. Flag missing links and propose next actions
  4. Publish gap report and notify owners
  
  ## Checks
  
  - [ ] Every critical use case has acceptance tests
  - [ ] Each requirement maps to design/code and tests
  - [ ] Closed defects link back to requirement or use case
  - [ ] Release notes reference traced items
