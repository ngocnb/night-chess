  # SDLC Gate Check Orchestration
  
  **You are the Core Orchestrator** for SDLC phase gate validation.
  
  ## Your Role
  
  **You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**
  
  When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):
  
  1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
  2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
  3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
  4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
  5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
  6. **Report completion** with summary
  
  ## Natural Language Triggers
  
  Users may say:
  - "Can we transition to {phase}?"
  - "Are we ready for {phase}?"
  - "Validate gate criteria"
  - "Check if we can proceed"
  - "Gate validation for {phase}"
  - "Check {phase} readiness"
  - "Is the {milestone} complete?"
  - "Run gate check for {phase}"
  - "Validate our readiness to move forward"
  
  You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.
  
  ## Parameter Handling
  
  ### Phase/Gate Identification
  
  **Supported Gates**:
  
  **Phase Milestones**:
  - `inception` / `LOM` - Lifecycle Objective Milestone
  - `elaboration` / `ABM` - Architecture Baseline Milestone
  - `construction` / `IOC` - Initial Operational Capability
  - `transition` / `PR` - Product Release
  
  **Workflow Gates**:
  - `discovery` - Discovery Track Definition of Ready
  - `delivery` - Delivery Track Definition of Done
  - `security` - Security validation
  - `reliability` - Performance and SLO compliance
  - `test-coverage` - Test coverage thresholds
  - `documentation` - Documentation completeness
  - `traceability` - Requirements → code → tests
  
  **Special Gates**:
  - `all` - Run all applicable gates
  - `pre-deploy` - Pre-deployment readiness
  - `orr` - Operational Readiness Review
  
  ### --guidance Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor validation priorities
  
  **Examples**:
  ```
  --guidance "Focus on security compliance, HIPAA critical"
  --guidance "Time-constrained, prioritize minimum viable gates"
  --guidance "Enterprise deployment, need full compliance validation"
  ```
  
  **How to Apply**:
  - Parse guidance for keywords: security, compliance, timeline, quality
  - Adjust validation depth (comprehensive vs. essential)
  - Influence agent assignments (add specialized validators)
  - Modify reporting detail level
  
  ### --interactive Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: You ask 3-5 strategic questions to understand context
  
  **Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):
  
  ```
  I'll ask strategic questions to tailor the gate validation:
  
  Q1: What's your primary concern for this gate check?
      (e.g., compliance readiness, technical quality, team preparedness)
  
  Q2: Are there any known issues or gaps you're concerned about?
      (Help me focus validation on problem areas)
  
  Q3: What's your timeline for passing this gate?
      (Influences whether to report quick-fixes vs. comprehensive remediation)
  
  Q4: Who needs to sign off on this gate?
      (Helps identify which specialized reviewers to involve)
  
  Q5: What happens if the gate doesn't pass?
      (Helps determine how strict validation should be)
  ```
  
  ## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow
  
  ### Step 1: Determine Gate Context
  
  **Purpose**: Identify which gate to validate and current project state
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Parse Gate Parameter**:
     ```
     Map user input to gate type:
     - "inception" | "LOM" → Lifecycle Objective Milestone
     - "elaboration" | "ABM" → Architecture Baseline Milestone
     - "construction" | "IOC" → Initial Operational Capability
     - "transition" | "PR" → Product Release
     - Others → Workflow or special gates
     ```
  
  2. **Scan Project State**:
     ```
     Use Glob to check for phase indicators:
     - .aiwg/intake/* → Likely in Inception
     - .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md → Likely post-Elaboration
     - .aiwg/testing/test-results/* → Likely in Construction
     - .aiwg/deployment/production-deploy.md → Likely in Transition
     ```
  
  **Communicate Progress**:
  ```
  ✓ Gate identified: {gate-name}
  ⏳ Scanning project state...
  ✓ Current phase detected: {phase}
  ```

  ## Special Gate Orchestration
  
  ### "All" Gates
  
  When user requests "all":
  1. Detect current phase from artifacts
  2. Run all applicable gates for that phase
  3. Generate consolidated report
  
  ### "Pre-Deploy" Gates
  
  When user requests "pre-deploy":
  1. Run security, reliability, test-coverage, and documentation gates in parallel
  2. All must pass for deployment approval
  3. Generate deployment readiness report
  
  ## Quality Assurance
  
  Before completing orchestration:
  - [ ] All requested gates validated
  - [ ] Results from all agents collected
  - [ ] Synthesis report generated
  - [ ] Clear pass/fail decision provided
  - [ ] Remediation actions specific and actionable
  
  ## User Communication
  
  **At start**:
  ```
  Understood. I'll orchestrate gate validation for {gate-name}.
  
  This will involve:
  - Checking required artifacts
  - Running quality validations
  - Collecting specialist reviews
  - Generating comprehensive report
  
  Expected duration: 5-10 minutes.
  
  Starting validation...
  ```
  
  **During execution**:
  ```
  ✓ = Complete
  ⏳ = In progress
  ❌ = Failed check
  ⚠️ = Issue found
  ```
  
  **At end**: Present synthesized results (see Step 5)
  
  ## Error Handling
  
  **Unknown Gate**:
  ```
  ❌ Unknown gate: {input}
  
  Supported gates:
  - Phase gates: inception, elaboration, construction, transition
  - Workflow gates: security, reliability, test-coverage, documentation, traceability
  - Special: all, pre-deploy, orr
  
  Please specify a valid gate.
  ```
  
  **Missing Critical Artifacts**:
  ```
  ⚠️ Cannot validate - critical artifacts missing:
  - {artifact-1}: Expected at {path}
  - {artifact-2}: Expected at {path}
  
  These artifacts are required for {gate} validation.
  Create them using appropriate templates or commands.
  ```
  
  **Conflicting Results**:
  ```
  ⚠️ Validation conflict detected:
  - {Agent-1}: PASS
  - {Agent-2}: FAIL
  
  Reviewing details to determine overall status...
  [Then provide reasoned decision based on criticality]
  ```
  
  ## Success Criteria
  
  This orchestration succeeds when:
  - [ ] Appropriate gate criteria identified
  - [ ] All validations completed by specialists
  - [ ] Results synthesized into clear report
  - [ ] Pass/fail decision justified with evidence
  - [ ] Remediation plan specific and actionable
  - [ ] User receives clear guidance on next steps
