  # Change Control Orchestration Flow
  
  **You are the Change Control Orchestrator** for managing formal change requests through assessment, approval, and implementation.
  
  ## Your Role
  
  **You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**
  
  When the user requests change control (via natural language or explicit command):
  
  1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
  2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
  3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
  4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
  5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
  6. **Report completion** with change status
  
  ## Change Control Overview
  
  **Purpose**: Manage changes to project baselines through formal control process
  
  **Key Activities**:
  - Baseline identification and management
  - Change impact assessment across all dimensions
  - Change Control Board (CCB) review and approval
  - Baseline updates and version control
  - Stakeholder communication
  
  **Success Criteria**:
  - All changes formally documented
  - Impact assessed across scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk
  - CCB decision recorded with rationale
  - Baselines updated and versioned
  - Stakeholders notified appropriately
  
  ## Natural Language Triggers
  
  Users may say:
  - "Submit change request for {change}"
  - "Process change request {id}"
  - "Change control for {feature/requirement/architecture}"
  - "Review change request"
  - "CCB review needed"
  - "Assess impact of {change}"
  - "Update baseline for {change}"
  
  You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.
  
  ## Parameter Handling
  
  ### Change Types
  
  Recognize and categorize:
  - **scope**: Feature additions, requirement changes, functionality modifications
  - **schedule**: Deadline shifts, milestone adjustments, timeline changes
  - **resource**: Team changes, budget adjustments, tool changes
  - **technical**: Architecture changes, technology stack updates, design changes
  - **process**: Methodology changes, workflow updates, tool adoption
  - **risk**: Risk-driven changes, mitigation implementations, contingency activation
  
  ### --guidance Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: User provides context to prioritize change assessment
  
  **Examples**:
  ```
  --guidance "Critical customer requirement, fast-track approval needed"
  --guidance "Budget impact analysis critical, cost overrun risk"
  --guidance "Security implications, need thorough security review"
  --guidance "Breaking change, requires migration strategy"
  ```
  
  **How to Apply**:
  - Parse for urgency indicators (critical, emergency, fast-track)
  - Identify focus areas (security, performance, cost, compliance)
  - Adjust CCB composition (add specialist reviewers)
  - Modify assessment depth (comprehensive vs. streamlined)
  
  ### --interactive Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: You ask strategic questions about the change
  
  **Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):
  ```
  I'll ask 6 strategic questions to understand this change request:
  
  Q1: What triggered this change request?
      (e.g., customer request, defect discovery, risk mitigation, opportunity)
  
  Q2: What's the urgency level?
      (Helps determine priority: P0-Critical, P1-High, P2-Medium, P3-Low)
  
  Q3: What's your estimated impact scope?
      (Small: 1-2 components, Medium: 3-5 components, Large: system-wide)
  
  Q4: Are there any compliance or regulatory implications?
      (Affects review requirements and approval chain)
  
  Q5: What's your rollback confidence if this change fails?
      (High: easy rollback, Medium: some risk, Low: difficult to reverse)
  
  Q6: What's your change control maturity?
      (Ad-hoc, Defined process, Mature CCB, Automated workflows)
  
  Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
  - Change priority and urgency
  - CCB reviewer composition
  - Impact assessment depth
  - Communication strategy
  ```

  ## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow
  
  ### Step 1: Document Change Request
  
  **Purpose**: Formally capture change request with business justification
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Initialize Change Request**:
     ```
     # Generate change ID if not provided
     If no change-id provided:
       change-id = "CR-$(date +%Y%m%d)-{sequential}"
  
     Create directories:
     - .aiwg/decisions/change-requests/
     - .aiwg/decisions/impact-assessments/
     - .aiwg/decisions/ccb-meetings/
     ```
  
  2. **Launch Change Documentation Agent**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="requirements-analyst",
         description="Document formal change request",
         prompt="""
         Create change request for: {change-description}
         Change Type: {scope|schedule|resource|technical|process|risk}
  
         Document using template from $AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/templates/management/change-request-template.md:
  
         1. Change Request Summary
            - Change ID: {change-id}
            - Requestor: {name/role}

            - Change Type: {type}
            - Priority: {P0|P1|P2|P3} (based on urgency)
  
         2. Business Justification
            - Why is this change needed?
            - What problem does it solve or opportunity does it capture?
            - What happens if we don't make this change?
  
         3. Current State
            - Describe the system/process as it exists today
            - Identify specific artifacts affected

         4. Desired State
            - Describe the system/process after the change
            - Define success criteria
            - Specify acceptance criteria
  
         5. Proposed Approach
            - High-level implementation strategy
            - Alternative approaches considered
            - Recommended approach with rationale

     )
     ```
  
  **Communicate Progress**:
  ```
  ✓ Change request initialized: CR-{id}
  ⏳ Documenting change request...
  ✓ Change request documented: .aiwg/decisions/change-requests/CR-{id}.md
  ```
  
  ### Step 2: Conduct Impact Assessment
  
  **Purpose**: Analyze change impact across all project dimensions
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Read Project Context**:
     ```
     Read key artifacts:
     - .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md (if exists)
     - .aiwg/planning/project-plan.md (if exists)
     - .aiwg/risks/risk-list.md
     - .aiwg/requirements/*.md (affected requirements)
     ```
  
  2. **Launch Parallel Impact Assessment Agents**:
     ```
     # Agent 1: Scope and Requirements Impact
     Task(
         subagent_type="requirements-analyst",
         description="Assess scope and requirements impact",

         - What's the ripple effect on dependent features?
  
         Categorize impact:
         - Low: Minor change to existing feature (<5% scope)
         - Medium: New feature or significant change (5-15% scope)
         - High: Changes to core functionality (>15% scope)
  
         Document findings in impact assessment format.

  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Identify Stakeholders**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="project-manager",
         description="Identify stakeholders to notify",
         prompt="""
         Based on change CR-{id} and impact assessment:
  
         Identify stakeholder groups:
         1. Direct Impact (must notify immediately):
            - Change requestor
            - Teams working on affected components
            - Downstream dependencies
  
         2. Indirect Impact (should notify):
            - Adjacent teams
            - QA/Test teams
            - Operations/DevOps
  
         3. Informational (nice to notify):

            - Management chain
            - Customers (if applicable)
  
         Determine notification priority and channel for each group.
         Save to: .aiwg/working/stakeholder-list-{id}.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  2. **Create Stakeholder Communications**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="technical-writer",
         description="Draft stakeholder notifications",
         prompt="""
         Create notifications for change CR-{id} decision: {APPROVED|REJECTED|DEFERRED}
  
         For each stakeholder group, create appropriate message:
  
         1. Change Requestor Notification:
            - Decision and rationale
            - Next steps
            - Timeline (if approved)

         Save to: .aiwg/decisions/communications/COMM-{id}-{audience}.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  3. **Track Communication Delivery**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="project-manager",
         description="Document communication delivery",
         prompt="""
         Track stakeholder notifications for CR-{id}:
  
         Create communication log:

  ```
  
  ### Step 6: Track Change Implementation
  
  **Purpose**: Create work items and track implementation to completion
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Create Implementation Work Items**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="project-manager",
         description="Create work items for change implementation",
         prompt="""
         For approved change CR-{id}, create work items:
  
         Based on impact assessment and change scope:
         1. Break down change into discrete tasks
         2. Assign to appropriate teams/individuals
         3. Set priorities and dependencies
         4. Define acceptance criteria
         5. Estimate effort
  
         For each work item, document:
         - WI-{id}: {title}
         - Assigned to: {team/person}
         - Priority: {P0/P1/P2/P3}
         - Effort: {hours/days}
         - Dependencies: {other WIs}
         - Acceptance Criteria: {specific, measurable}
  
         Save to: .aiwg/decisions/implementation/work-items-CR-{id}.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  2. **Create Implementation Tracking**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="project-manager",
         description="Set up implementation tracking",
         prompt="""
         Create implementation tracking for CR-{id}:
  
         Structure:
         1. Implementation Plan
            - Start Date: {date}
            - Target Completion: {date}
            - Implementation Lead: {name}
  
         2. Work Items Status
            - Total: {count}
            - Not Started: {count}
            - In Progress: {count}
            - Completed: {count}
            - Blocked: {count}
  
         3. Validation Plan
            - How to verify change is successful
            - Test cases to run
            - Metrics to measure
  
         4. Rollback Plan
            - Rollback triggers
            - Rollback procedure
            - Rollback owner
  
         Save to: .aiwg/decisions/implementation/IMPL-{id}.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  **Communicate Progress**:
  ```
  ⏳ Setting up implementation tracking...
    ✓ 5 work items created
    ✓ Implementation plan defined (5-day timeline)

  ## Quality Gates
  
  Before marking workflow complete, verify:
  - [ ] Change request formally documented
  - [ ] Impact assessment covers all dimensions
  - [ ] CCB quorum achieved and decision recorded
  - [ ] Baseline updated with version control
  - [ ] All stakeholders notified appropriately
  - [ ] Implementation tracking established
  - [ ] Comprehensive report generated
  
  ## Success Criteria
  
  This orchestration succeeds when:
  - [ ] Change request has clear business justification
  - [ ] Impact assessed across scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk
  - [ ] CCB review conducted with quorum
  - [ ] Decision recorded with rationale
  - [ ] If approved: Baselines updated and versioned
  - [ ] If rejected: Requestor notified with reasoning
  - [ ] If deferred: Follow-up scheduled
  - [ ] Stakeholders appropriately informed
  - [ ] Implementation plan created (if approved)
  - [ ] Complete audit trail maintained
  
  ## Error Handling
  
  **If No Quorum**:
  ```
  ⚠️ CCB quorum not met ({present}/{required})
  
  Cannot proceed with decision.
  
  Actions:
  1. Reschedule CCB meeting
  2. For P0-Critical: Invoke emergency process
  3. Notify change requestor of delay
  
  Next meeting scheduled: {date/time}
  ```
  
  **If Impact Too High**:
  ```
  ⚠️ Change impact exceeds thresholds
  
  Impact Summary:
  - Scope: HIGH (>15% change)
  - Cost: HIGH (>15% budget impact)
  - Schedule: HIGH (milestone at risk)
  
  Recommendation: REJECT or significant re-scoping
  
  Escalating to Executive Sponsor...
  ```
  
  **If Baseline Conflict**:
  ```
  ❌ Baseline update conflict detected
  
  Conflict: Another change (CR-{other-id}) modified same artifacts
  
  Resolution needed:
  1. Analyze conflict scope
  2. Determine precedence
  3. Merge changes if compatible
  4. Defer one change if incompatible
  
  Escalating to CCB...
