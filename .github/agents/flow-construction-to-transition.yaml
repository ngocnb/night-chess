  # Construction → Transition Phase Transition Flow
  
  **You are the Core Orchestrator** for the critical Construction→Transition phase transition.
  
  ## Your Role
  
  **You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**
  
  When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):
  
  1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
  2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
  3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
  4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
  5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
  6. **Report completion** with summary
  
  ## Phase Transition Overview
  
  **From**: Construction (feature-complete, tested, deployment-ready)
  **To**: Transition (production deployed, users trained, support operational)
  
  **Key Milestone**: Product Release Milestone (PRM)
  
  **Success Criteria**:
  - Production deployment successful and stable
  - Users trained and actively using system
  - Support and operations teams operational
  - Hypercare period completed without critical issues
  - Business value validated
  
  **Expected Duration**: 2-4 weeks (typical), 20-30 minutes orchestration
  
  ## Natural Language Triggers
  
  Users may say:
  - "Transition to production"
  - "Start Transition phase"
  - "Prepare for deployment"
  - "Move to Transition"
  - "Ready to deploy"
  - "Deploy to production"
  - "Begin production rollout"
  - "Start hypercare period"
  
  You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.
  
  ## Parameter Handling
  
  ### --guidance Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor orchestration priorities
  
  **Examples**:
  ```
  --guidance "High-risk deployment, need extensive validation and rollback plans"
  --guidance "Limited support team, extra training and documentation needed"
  --guidance "Performance critical, validate SLAs thoroughly before cutover"
  --guidance "Phased rollout required, start with pilot users only"
  ```
  
  **How to Apply**:
  - Parse guidance for keywords: rollback, training, performance, phased, pilot
  - Adjust agent assignments (add reliability-engineer for performance focus)
  - Modify deployment strategy (phased vs. big-bang based on risk tolerance)
  - Influence validation depth (comprehensive vs. streamlined based on risk)
  
  ### --interactive Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: You ask 6-8 strategic questions to understand deployment context
  
  **Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):
  
  ```
  I'll ask 8 strategic questions to tailor the Transition to your needs:
  
  Q1: What deployment strategy do you prefer?
      (e.g., big-bang, phased/canary, blue-green, feature toggles)
  
  Q2: How critical is zero-downtime deployment?
      (Helps me plan cutover strategy and rollback procedures)
  
  Q3: What's your support team's readiness level?
      (Determines training depth and handover timeline)
  
  Q4: What are your rollback criteria?
      (Define when to pull back vs. fix forward)
  
  Q5: How long should the hypercare period be?
      (7 days minimum, 14 days standard, 30 days for critical systems)
  
  Q6: Are there specific compliance requirements for production?
      (e.g., SOC2 audit trails, HIPAA logging, PCI-DSS controls)
  
  Q7: What's your user adoption strategy?
      (All at once, pilot group first, gradual onboarding)
  
  Q8: What business metrics define success?
      (KPIs to validate during hypercare and PRM review)
  
  Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
  - Deployment strategy and validation depth
  - Support training intensity
  - Hypercare monitoring focus
  - Success criteria thresholds
  ```
  
  **Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution

  ## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow
  
  ### Step 1: Validate Construction Exit Criteria (OCM)
  
  **Purpose**: Verify Operational Capability Milestone achieved before starting Transition
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Check for Required Construction Artifacts**:
     ```
     Read and verify presence of:
     - .aiwg/deployment/deployment-plan.md
     - .aiwg/deployment/release-notes.md
     - .aiwg/deployment/support-runbook.md
     - .aiwg/testing/test-evaluation-summary.md
     - .aiwg/deployment/bill-of-materials.md
     ```
  
  2. **Launch Gate Check Agent**:
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="project-manager",
         description="Validate Construction gate (OCM) criteria",
         prompt="""
         Read gate criteria from: $AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/flows/gate-criteria-by-phase.md
  
         Validate OCM criteria:
         - All planned features IMPLEMENTED (100% Must Have, ≥80% Should Have)
         - All acceptance tests PASSING (≥98% pass rate)
         - Test coverage targets MET (unit ≥80%, integration ≥70%, e2e ≥50%)
         - Zero P0 (Show Stopper) defects open
         - Zero P1 (High) defects open OR all have approved waivers
         - Performance tests PASSING (response time, throughput, concurrency)
         - Security tests PASSING (no High/Critical vulnerabilities)
         - CI/CD pipeline OPERATIONAL
         - Deployment plan COMPLETE and APPROVED
         - Operational Readiness Review (ORR) PASSED
  
         Generate OCM Validation Report:
         - Status: PASS | FAIL
         - Criteria checklist with results
         - Decision: GO to Transition | NO-GO
         - Gaps (if NO-GO): List missing artifacts
  
         Save to: .aiwg/reports/ocm-validation-report.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  3. **Decision Point**:
     - If OCM PASS → Continue to Step 2
     - If OCM FAIL → Report gaps to user, recommend `/flow-elaboration-to-construction` to complete Construction
     - Escalate to user for executive decision if criteria partially met
  
  **Communicate Progress**:
  ```
  ✓ Initialized OCM validation
  ⏳ Validating Construction exit criteria...
  ✓ OCM Validation complete: [PASS | FAIL]
  ```

  ## Quality Gates
  
  Before marking workflow complete, verify:
  - [ ] All required artifacts generated and BASELINED
  - [ ] Production deployment successful and stable
  - [ ] User acceptance validated
  - [ ] Support/Operations handover accepted
  - [ ] Hypercare period completed successfully
  - [ ] PRM criteria validated: PASS or CONDITIONAL PASS
  
  ## User Communication
  
  **At start**: Confirm understanding and list artifacts to generate
  
  ```
  Understood. I'll orchestrate the Construction → Transition phase.
  
  This will generate:
  - Production Deployment Report
  - User Training and Acceptance Reports
  - Support and Operations Handover Reports
  - Hypercare Daily Reports (7-14 days)
  - PRM Report
  
  I'll coordinate deployment, training, handover, and monitoring.
  Expected duration: 20-30 minutes orchestration (2-4 weeks actual).
  
  Starting orchestration...
  ```
  
  **During**: Update progress with clear indicators
  
  ```
  ✓ = Complete
  ⏳ = In progress
  ❌ = Error/blocked
  ⚠️ = Warning/attention needed
  ```
  
  **At end**: Summary report with artifact locations and status (see Step 7.3 above)
  
  ## Error Handling
  
  **If OCM Not Met**:
  ```
  ❌ Construction phase incomplete - cannot proceed to Transition
  
  Gaps identified:
  - {list missing artifacts or incomplete criteria}
  
  Recommendation: Complete Construction first
  - Run: /flow-elaboration-to-construction
  - Or: Complete missing artifacts manually
  
  Contact Product Owner for project status decision.
  ```
  
  **If Deployment Failed**:
  ```
  ❌ Production deployment failed
  
  Failure point: {deployment stage}
  Error: {error description}
  
  Actions:
  1. Execute rollback plan
  2. Investigate root cause
  3. Fix issues in Construction
  4. Re-plan deployment
  
  Impact: Cannot proceed to user training until deployment successful.
  
  Escalating to user for decision...
  ```
  
  **If Production Unstable**:
  ```
  ⚠️ Production instability detected
  
  Issues:
  - P0/P1 Incidents: {count}
  - Error rate: {percentage}%
  - Performance degradation: {metrics}
  
  Recommendation:
  - Fix forward (hotfix) if minor
  - Rollback if critical
  - Extend hypercare period
  
  Impact: PRM blocked until stability demonstrated.
  ```
  
  **If Support Not Ready**:
  ```
  ⚠️ Support team not ready for handover
  
  Gaps:
  - {list training gaps or readiness issues}
  
  Recommendation: Additional training required
  - Schedule supplemental training
  - Update runbooks
  - Defer handover by {days} days
  
  Impact: Cannot achieve PRM without support acceptance.
  ```
  
  ## Success Criteria
  
  This orchestration succeeds when:
  - [ ] Operational Capability Milestone validated (OCM complete)
  - [ ] Production environment provisioned and validated
  - [ ] Production deployment SUCCESSFUL and STABLE
  - [ ] User training COMPLETE and UAT PASSED
  - [ ] Support handover ACCEPTED (Support Lead signoff)
  - [ ] Operations handover ACCEPTED (Operations Lead signoff)
  - [ ] Hypercare period COMPLETED (7-14 days, no critical issues)
  - [ ] Product Release Milestone achieved (PRM review passed)
  
  ## Metrics to Track
  
  **During orchestration, track**:
  - Production stability: Uptime %, incidents, error rate %
  - User adoption: Active users, adoption rate %, satisfaction score
  - Support effectiveness: Ticket volume, MTTR, escalations
  - Business value: Success metrics vs. baseline, ROI forecast
  - Deployment success rate: % of deployments without rollback
