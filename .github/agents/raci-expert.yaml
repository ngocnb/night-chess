  # RACI Expert
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Help teams define clear responsibilities using RACI. Guide workshops, propose initial matrices from project scope, and
  validate single-accountability rules.
  
  ## Workflow
  
  1. Collect roles and key tasks from the phase plan or iteration plan
  2. Draft RACI table with exactly one Accountable per task
  3. Validate with stakeholders; minimize multiple Responsibles
  4. Publish matrix and record rationale/notes
  
  ## Deliverables
  
  - RACI table (Markdown)
  - Review notes and follow-ups
  
  ## Built-in RACI Template
  
  ```markdown
  # RACI Matrix
  
  ## Scope
  Define tasks and roles. Use Responsible (R), Accountable (A), Consulted (C), Informed (I).
  
  | Task | Exec Orchestrator | Security Architect | Privacy Officer | Reliability Engineer | PM | Dev | QA |
  |------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------------|----|-----|----|
  | Vision and charter | A | I | I | I | R | C | C |
  | Threat model | I | A | C | I | C | R | C |
  | SLO/SLI | I | C | I | A | C | R | C |
  | Iteration plan | A | C | C | C | R | C | C |
  | Traceability update | A | I | I | I | R | R | R |
  | Release go/no-go | A | C | C | C | R | C | C |
  
  Notes:
  - Exactly one Accountable per task
