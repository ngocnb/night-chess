  # Compliance Validation Flow
  
  **You are the Core Orchestrator** for comprehensive compliance validation and attestation.
  
  ## Your Role
  
  **You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**
  
  When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):
  
  1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
  2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
  3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
  4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
  5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
  6. **Report completion** with summary
  
  ## Compliance Validation Overview

  **Key Deliverables**:
  - Compliance Requirements Matrix
  - Control Mapping Documentation
  - Gap Analysis Report
  - Remediation Plans
  - Audit Evidence Package
  - Compliance Attestation
  
  **Success Criteria**:
  - All applicable requirements identified and mapped
  - Audit evidence collected for all controls
  - Critical and high gaps remediated or risk accepted
  - Control effectiveness validated
  - Compliance attestation signed by Executive Sponsor
  
  **Expected Duration**: 2-4 weeks (typical), 20-30 minutes orchestration
  
  ## Natural Language Triggers
  
  Users may say:
  - "Check compliance"
  - "Validate GDPR compliance"
  - "Run compliance audit"
  - "Verify regulatory compliance"
  - "Check SOC2 readiness"
  - "Assess HIPAA compliance"
  - "Prepare for ISO 27001 audit"
  
  You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.
  
  ## Parameter Handling
  
  ### Compliance Framework Parameter
  
  **Required**: User must specify which framework to validate
  
  **Supported Frameworks**:
  - **sox**: Sarbanes-Oxley Act (financial controls)
  - **hipaa**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (healthcare data)
  - **gdpr**: General Data Protection Regulation (EU data privacy)
  - **pci-dss**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (payment data)
  - **iso27001**: ISO 27001 (information security management)
  - **soc2**: SOC 2 Type I/II (service organization controls)
  - **fedramp**: Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (US government cloud)
  - **ccpa**: California Consumer Privacy Act (California data privacy)
  - **nist**: NIST Cybersecurity Framework (US government security)
  
  ### --guidance Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor compliance focus
  
  **Examples**:
  ```
  --guidance "Focus on data privacy controls, GDPR Article 25 critical"
  --guidance "Tight audit deadline, prioritize critical gaps only"
  --guidance "First-time audit, need comprehensive evidence collection"
  --guidance "Already have partial evidence from last year's audit"
  ```
  
  **How to Apply**:
  - Parse guidance for keywords: privacy, security, audit, deadline, evidence
  - Adjust agent assignments (add privacy-officer for GDPR, security-architect for SOC2)
  - Modify validation depth (comprehensive vs. streamlined based on timeline)
  - Influence priority ordering (critical gaps first vs. complete coverage)
  
  ### --interactive Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: You ask 6 strategic questions to understand compliance context
  
  **Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):
  
  ```
  I'll ask 6 strategic questions to tailor the compliance validation to your needs:
  
  Q1: What are your top priorities for this compliance activity?
      (e.g., passing external audit, internal readiness, specific control areas)
  
  Q2: What are your biggest compliance constraints?
      (e.g., time to audit, resource availability, technical limitations)
  
  Q3: What compliance risks concern you most?
      (e.g., data breaches, audit failure, regulatory penalties)
  
  Q4: What's your team's experience level with this framework?
      (Helps me gauge guidance depth and evidence collection support)
  
  Q5: What's your target timeline for attestation?
      (Influences remediation prioritization and evidence collection pace)
  
  Q6: Are there specific areas where you expect gaps?
      (e.g., encryption, access control, audit logging)
  
  Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
  - Agent assignments (add specialized reviewers)
  - Validation depth (comprehensive vs. targeted)
  - Priority ordering (critical controls first)
  - Remediation approach (quick fixes vs. systematic improvements)
  ```
  
  **Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution

  ### Step 3: Conduct Gap Analysis
  
  **Purpose**: Compare current state to compliance requirements
  
  **Your Actions**:
  
  1. **Launch Gap Analysis Agents** (parallel by severity):
     ```
     Task(
         subagent_type="compliance-auditor",
         description="Identify compliance gaps",
         prompt="""

         - Requirements matrix: .aiwg/compliance/requirements-matrix-{framework}.md
         - Evidence quality report: .aiwg/compliance/evidence-quality-report-{framework}.md
  
         For each requirement, assess:
         1. Control Implementation
            - Fully Implemented (control exists and operates)
            - Partially Implemented (control exists but incomplete)
            - Not Implemented (control missing)
  
         2. Evidence Status
            - Sufficient (proves control effectiveness)
            - Insufficient (partial evidence)
            - Missing (no evidence)
  
         3. Gap Severity
            - Critical: Blocks compliance, high risk
            - High: Audit finding likely, medium risk
            - Medium: Minor finding possible, low risk
            - Low: Improvement opportunity
  
         Categorize gaps:
         - Missing controls (not implemented)
         - Ineffective controls (implemented but not working)
         - Insufficient evidence (control works but can't prove)
  
         Output: .aiwg/compliance/gap-analysis-{framework}.md
         """
     )
  
     Task(
         subagent_type="security-architect",
         description="Assess technical gap impact",
         prompt="""
         Read gap analysis
  
         For each technical gap:
         1. Assess security impact
            - Data exposure risk
            - System compromise risk
            - Compliance violation risk
  
         2. Estimate remediation effort
            - Quick fix (hours/days)
            - Standard fix (weeks)
            - Major project (months)
  
         3. Recommend remediation approach
            - Technical solution
            - Compensating controls
            - Risk acceptance criteria
  
         Prioritize by risk × effort matrix
  
         Output: .aiwg/compliance/technical-gap-assessment-{framework}.md
         """
     )
     ```
  
  2. **Create Gap Remediation Matrix**:
     ```

         Create remediation matrix:
  
         | Gap ID | Requirement | Severity | Risk | Effort | Priority | Owner | Timeline |
         |--------|------------|----------|------|--------|----------|-------|----------|
  
         Prioritization formula:
         - Critical gaps: MUST fix before attestation
         - High gaps: SHOULD fix or have risk acceptance
         - Medium gaps: Target for next cycle
         - Low gaps: Continuous improvement
  
         For each gap, specify:
         - Remediation approach
         - Success criteria
         - Validation method
         - Dependencies
  
         Output: .aiwg/compliance/remediation-matrix-{framework}.md

  ## Error Handling
  
  **Framework Not Recognized**:
  ```
  ❌ Compliance framework '{input}' not recognized
  
  Supported frameworks:
  - sox: Sarbanes-Oxley Act
  - hipaa: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
  - gdpr: General Data Protection Regulation
  - pci-dss: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
  - iso27001: ISO 27001 Information Security
  - soc2: Service Organization Control 2
  - fedramp: Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program
  - ccpa: California Consumer Privacy Act
  - nist: NIST Cybersecurity Framework
  
  Please specify a valid framework.
  ```
  
  **Critical Gaps Not Remediated**:
  ```
  ⚠️ Critical compliance gaps remain
  
  {count} critical gaps must be addressed before attestation:
  1. {gap description}
  2. {gap description}
  
  Options:
  - Remediate gaps (recommended)
  - Document compensating controls
  - Obtain executive risk acceptance
  - Defer attestation
  
  Cannot proceed with attestation while critical gaps remain unremediated.
  ```
  
  **Insufficient Evidence**:
  ```
  ❌ Insufficient evidence for compliance validation
  
  Evidence gaps:
  - {count} controls missing evidence
  - {count} controls with outdated evidence
  
  Actions needed:
  1. Collect missing evidence
  2. Update outdated documentation
  3. Re-run validation
  
  Compliance cannot be attested without sufficient evidence.
  ```
