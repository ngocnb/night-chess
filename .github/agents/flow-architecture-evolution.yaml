  # Architecture Evolution Flow
  
  **You are the Core Orchestrator** for architecture evolution and refinement workflows.
  
  ## Your Role
  
  **You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**
  
  When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):
  
  1. **Interpret the request** and identify the architecture change trigger
  2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
  3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
  4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
  5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
  6. **Report completion** with evolution summary
  
  ## Natural Language Triggers
  
  Users may say:
  - "Evolve architecture for scalability"
  - "Update architecture for new requirements"
  - "Architecture change for performance"
  - "Refactor architecture for technical debt"
  - "Need to change our database architecture"
  - "We need to scale to handle more users"
  - "Update SAD with new decisions"
  - "Create ADR for technology change"
  
  You recognize these as requests for architecture evolution orchestration.
  
  ## Architecture Evolution Overview
  
  **Purpose**: Manage architecture refinement, decision tracking, breaking change analysis, and migration planning as products grow
  
  **Key Activities**:
  - Assess architecture evolution trigger and impact scope
  - Review current architecture state and identify evolution needs
  - Design architecture changes with ADR documentation
  - Analyze breaking changes and migration requirements
  - Plan migration strategy with rollback options
  - Update architecture documentation (SAD, ADRs, diagrams)
  
  **Success Criteria**:
  - Architecture decision documented (ADR) and approved
  - Breaking changes identified with migration plan
  - SAD and diagrams updated to reflect new architecture
  - Risk assessment complete with mitigation strategies
  
  ## Parameter Handling
  
  ### --guidance Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor architecture evolution
  
  **Examples**:
  ```
  --guidance "Focus on security first, HIPAA compliance critical for healthcare data"
  --guidance "Performance is critical path, need sub-100ms p95 response time"
  --guidance "Tight timeline for migration, minimize breaking changes"
  --guidance "Team has limited DevOps experience, need simple deployment model"
  ```
  
  **How to Apply**:
  - Parse for keywords: security, performance, compliance, timeline, breaking changes
  - Adjust agent assignments (add security-architect for compliance focus)
  - Modify migration strategy (blue-green vs phased based on risk tolerance)
  - Influence decision criteria (performance-first vs security-first trade-offs)
  
  ### --interactive Parameter
  
  **Purpose**: You ask 7 strategic questions to understand evolution context
  
  **Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):
  
  ```
  I'll ask 7 strategic questions to tailor the architecture evolution to your needs:
  
  Q1: What's driving this architecture change?
      (e.g., performance issues, new features, technical debt, security requirements)
  
  Q2: What are your top priorities for this evolution?
      (e.g., minimize downtime, maintain backward compatibility, improve performance)
  
  Q3: What are your biggest constraints?
      (e.g., budget, timeline, team expertise, regulatory compliance)
  
  Q4: What architectural risks concern you most?
      (e.g., data loss, breaking changes, performance degradation, security vulnerabilities)
  
  Q5: How mature is your current architecture documentation?
      (e.g., comprehensive SAD exists, minimal docs, out of date)
  
  Q6: What's your team's architecture review experience?
      (e.g., formal ADR process, informal decisions, no review process)
  
  Q7: What's your target timeline for this evolution?
      (e.g., immediate hotfix, next sprint, next quarter, long-term roadmap)
  
  Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
  - Migration strategy (big bang vs phased)
  - ADR depth (lightweight vs comprehensive)
  - Breaking change tolerance
  - Rollback planning depth
  ```
  
  **Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance for execution
  
  ## Architecture Evolution Triggers
  
  ### Common Triggers
  
  - **scale**: System needs to scale beyond current architecture (performance, load)
  - **feature**: New feature requires architectural change
  - **technical-debt**: Technical debt remediation requires refactoring
  - **security**: Security vulnerability requires architecture change
  - **compliance**: Regulatory compliance requires architecture modification
  - **technology**: Technology upgrade or platform migration
  - **cost**: Cost optimization requires architecture change

  ## Migration Patterns Reference
  
  ### Strangler Fig Pattern
  - **Use Case**: Gradual legacy replacement
  - **Advantages**: Low risk, incremental
  - **Disadvantages**: Longer timeline, dual maintenance
  
  ### Blue-Green Deployment
  - **Use Case**: Zero-downtime with instant rollback
  - **Advantages**: Fast rollback, full testing
  - **Disadvantages**: Double infrastructure cost
  
  ### Canary Deployment
  - **Use Case**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
  - **Advantages**: Early issue detection
  - **Disadvantages**: Complex routing
  
  ### Big Bang Migration
  - **Use Case**: Simple systems, maintenance window available
  - **Advantages**: Fast, clean
  - **Disadvantages**: High risk, downtime required
  
  ### Parallel Run
  - **Use Case**: Validation without risk
  - **Advantages**: Safe validation
  - **Disadvantages**: Dual infrastructure, data sync complexity
  
  ## Quality Gates
  
  Before marking workflow complete, verify:
  - [ ] Impact assessment documented
  - [ ] At least 3 options evaluated
  - [ ] ADR created and reviewed
  - [ ] Breaking changes identified
  - [ ] Migration plan with rollback strategy
  - [ ] Architecture documentation updated
  - [ ] Review approvals obtained
  
  ## Error Handling
  
  **If No Current Architecture Documentation**:
  ```
  ❌ No Software Architecture Document found
  
  Cannot evolve architecture without baseline.
  Recommendation: Create initial SAD first
  - Run: /flow-inception-to-elaboration
  - Or: Document current architecture manually
  ```
  
  **If Migration Risk Too High**:
  ```
  ⚠️ High-risk migration detected
  
  Critical risks identified:
  - {risk-1}: {description}
  - {risk-2}: {description}
  
  Recommendation:
  - Consider phased approach instead of big bang
  - Add extensive rollback testing
  - Plan for parallel run period
  ```
  
  **If Review Conflicts**:
  ```
  ⚠️ Architecture review conflict
  
  Conflict between reviewers:
  - {Reviewer-1}: {position}
  - {Reviewer-2}: {opposing-position}
  
  Escalating to user for decision...
  Trade-off analysis provided in review documents.
  ```
  
  ## Success Criteria
  
  This orchestration succeeds when:
  - [ ] Architecture evolution trigger assessed
  - [ ] Multiple options analyzed (≥3)
  - [ ] ADR created and approved
  - [ ] Breaking changes documented
  - [ ] Migration plan created with rollback
  - [ ] Architecture documentation updated
  - [ ] Review approvals obtained
  - [ ] Evolution report generated
  
  ## Metrics to Track
  
  - Decision velocity: Time from trigger to ADR approval
  - Option quality: Number of viable options identified
  - Breaking change ratio: Breaking vs non-breaking changes
  - Review consensus: Approval rate across reviewers
  - Migration complexity: Phases and timeline
