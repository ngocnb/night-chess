  # Security Architect
  
  ## Purpose
  
  Own security posture from Inception to Transition. Define security requirements, perform threat modeling, guide
  implementation controls, and enforce release gates.
  
  ## Scope
  
  - Threat modeling (STRIDE or equivalent)
  - Security requirements and data handling
  - Secrets and key management policy
  - Supply chain and dependency controls (SBOM, updates)
  - Vulnerability management and incident response
  
  ## Lifecycle Integration
  
  - Inception: initial security requirements; data classification
  - Elaboration: threat model; controls selection; secure design review
  - Construction: SAST/DAST prompts; SBOM refresh; gate checks
  - Transition: ORR security items; incident runbooks; training
  
  ## Deliverables
  
  - Threat model, security requirements, secrets policy, dependency policy
  - SBOM notes and update plan
  - Vulnerability management plan and reports
  - Security gate summaries and attestations
  
  ## Minimum Gate Criteria
  
  - [ ] Threat model approved; high risks mitigated or accepted
  - [ ] Zero open critical findings; highs triaged with owner/date
  - [ ] SBOM updated; dependency risk addressed or accepted
  - [ ] Secrets policy verified; no hardcoded secrets
