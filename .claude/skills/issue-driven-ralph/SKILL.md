# Issue-Driven Ralph Loop Skill

## Triggers

Activate this skill when the user says:
- "address the open issues"
- "work through the bugs"
- "fix open issues"
- "tackle issue {N}"
- "address issues {N}, {M}, {P}"
- "work on the bug backlog"
- "fix the reported bugs"
- "go through the open tickets"
- "handle the issue queue"
- "process the open issues"
- "work on issue {N}"

## Purpose

Transforms the issue tracker from a passive record into an active 2-way collaboration surface. Each ralph cycle posts structured status to the issue thread, scans for human feedback, and responds substantively. The human can monitor and steer agent work asynchronously by commenting on the issue.

## Behavior

When triggered, this skill invokes the `/address-issues` command with appropriate parameters extracted from the user's natural language request.

### Parameter Extraction

| User Says | Extracted Parameters |
|-----------|---------------------|
| "address issues 17 18 19" | `17 18 19` |
| "fix open bugs" | `--filter "status:open label:bug"` |
| "work on the bug backlog" | `--filter "status:open label:bug"` |
| "tackle issue 17" | `17` |
| "go through all open issues" | `--all-open` |
| "address the open issues interactively" | `--all-open --interactive` |
| "focus on security bugs" | `--all-open --guidance "Focus on security bugs"` |
| "fix bugs 17-19, they're all auth related" | `17 18 19 --guidance "These are all related to auth"` |

### Parameter Support

This skill supports the standard AIWG `--interactive` and `--guidance` parameters:

**`--interactive`**: When detected in user intent (e.g., "interactively", "walk me through"), adds `--interactive` to invoke discovery questions before starting and pause between issues for human go/no-go.

**`--guidance`**: When the user provides upfront direction (e.g., "focus on bugs", "skip feature requests", "security first"), extracts the guidance text and passes it via `--guidance "..."` to tailor prioritization and approach without interactive prompts.

### Execution Steps

1. **Parse intent** — identify issue numbers, filters, or "all open" from user message
2. **Invoke `/address-issues`** with extracted parameters
3. **Monitor execution** — the command handles the full cycle protocol

### The 3-Step Cycle Protocol

Each cycle of the ralph loop follows this protocol:

**Step 1: Work** — Read issue context, implement fix/feature, run tests

**Step 2: Post Status** — Post structured comment to the issue thread:
```
**RALPH CYCLE #N – [Progress|Blocked|Review Needed]**
- Actions taken this cycle
- Task checklist (updated)
- Blockers (if any)
- Next steps
```

**Step 3: Scan & Respond** — Read all new thread comments, classify them (feedback/question/approval/correction), and incorporate into the next cycle. Never ignore human input.

### Thread Scanning Classification

| Comment Type | Agent Response |
|-------------|---------------|
| Feedback | Incorporate into next cycle's work |
| Question | Answer in next status comment |
| Approval | Proceed to next phase or close issue |
| Correction | Adjust approach, acknowledge the change |
| Automated/bot | Ignore |

### Completion Criteria (per issue)

An issue is resolved when:
- Implementation is complete
- Tests pass
- Documentation updated (if needed)
- All thread feedback addressed
- No unresolved blocker comments

### Multi-Issue Strategy

| Strategy | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| Sequential | Default — one issue at a time |
| Batched | When user mentions "related" issues or same module |
| Parallel | When user says "in parallel" (respects context budget) |

## Integration

### Issue Tracker APIs

**Gitea** (via MCP tools):
- `mcp__gitea__list_repo_issues` — list issues
- `mcp__gitea__get_issue_by_index` — read issue
- `mcp__gitea__get_issue_comments_by_index` — read thread
- `mcp__gitea__create_issue_comment` — post status
- `mcp__gitea__edit_issue` — update labels/status

**GitHub** (via `gh` CLI):
- `gh issue list` — list issues
- `gh issue view N` — read issue
- `gh issue comment N --body "..."` — post status
- `gh issue close N` — close resolved

### Related Commands

| Command | Integration |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ralph` | Core loop engine |
| `/issue-list` | Fetches issues by filter |
| `/issue-comment` | Posts cycle status comments |
| `/issue-close` | Closes resolved issues |
| `/issue-sync` | Links commits to issues |

## Safety

- Never force-push or make destructive git changes
- Always run tests before posting completion status
- Respect `--max-cycles` limit (default: 6)
- Post status every cycle — transparency is mandatory
- On error, post blocker comment rather than failing silently
- In `--interactive` mode, pause between issues for human go/no-go

## Configuration

Default settings (overridable via parameters):
- Max cycles per issue: 6
- Strategy: sequential
- Provider: auto-detect from project config
- Branch per issue: false
- Interactive: false

## Examples

### Fix a specific bug
```
User: "tackle issue 17"
→ /address-issues 17
```

### Work through the bug backlog
```
User: "work on the bug backlog"
→ /address-issues --filter "status:open label:bug"
```

### Interactive session on multiple issues
```
User: "address issues 17, 18, 19 interactively"
→ /address-issues 17 18 19 --interactive
```

### All open issues with higher cycle limit
```
User: "go through all open issues, give each one up to 8 cycles"
→ /address-issues --all-open --max-cycles 8
```

### With guidance
```
User: "fix the open bugs, focus on security issues first"
→ /address-issues --filter "status:open label:bug" --guidance "Security issues are top priority"
```

### Guidance with batch context
```
User: "address issues 17, 18, 19 — they're all related to the auth refactor"
→ /address-issues 17 18 19 --guidance "These are all related to the auth refactor, address them as a batch"
```
