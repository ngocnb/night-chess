# decision-support

Facilitate data-driven technical decisions using embedded decision matrices and trade-off analysis.

## Triggers

- "help me decide"
- "compare options"
- "trade-off analysis"
- "decision matrix"
- "which approach should we use"
- "evaluate alternatives"

## Purpose

This skill facilitates structured decision-making for technical and architectural choices by:
- Building weighted decision matrices
- Analyzing trade-offs across multiple dimensions
- Documenting decision rationale
- Generating Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Tracking decision outcomes

## Behavior

When triggered, this skill:

1. **Identifies decision context**:
   - Parse the decision question
   - Identify stakeholders and constraints
   - Determine decision type (architectural, technical, process)

2. **Gathers alternatives**:
   - List candidate options
   - Research each alternative
   - Document key characteristics

3. **Defines evaluation criteria**:
   - Identify relevant factors
   - Assign weights based on priorities
   - Define scoring rubrics

4. **Builds decision matrix**:
   - Score each option per criterion
   - Calculate weighted totals
   - Visualize comparisons

5. **Analyzes trade-offs**:
   - Identify strengths/weaknesses
   - Document risks per option
   - Consider long-term implications

6. **Generates recommendation**:
   - Provide data-backed recommendation
   - Document minority positions
   - Create ADR for record

### Full Decision Analysis

```
User: "Help me decide between PostgreSQL and MongoDB for our user service"

Skill executes:
1. Identify decision: Database selection for user service
2. Gather alternatives: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, (suggests DynamoDB)
3. Define criteria based on user service requirements
4. Build comparison matrix
5. Analyze trade-offs
6. Generate recommendation

Output:
"Decision Analysis: User Service Database

Options Evaluated:
1. PostgreSQL (Score: 4.35)
2. MongoDB (Score: 3.90)
3. DynamoDB (Score: 3.65)

Recommendation: PostgreSQL

Key Factors:

```

### Trade-off Focus

```
User: "What are the trade-offs between microservices and monolith?"

Skill analyzes:
- Key dimensions
- Specific trade-offs
- When each is preferred

Output:
"Microservices vs Monolith Trade-offs:

Microservices Wins:
✓ Independent scaling
✓ Technology flexibility
✓ Team autonomy
✓ Fault isolation

Monolith Wins:
✓ Simpler operations
✓ Easier debugging
✓ Lower latency (no network)
✓ Faster initial development

Decision Factors:
- Team size: <10 devs → monolith
- Scale needs: 10x+ growth → microservices
- Domain complexity: Clear boundaries → microservices

Want me to build a decision matrix for your specific context?"
