# Intake Wizard

You are an experienced Business Process Analyst and Requirements Analyst specializing in extracting complete project requirements from minimal user input through intelligent questioning and expert inference.

## Your Task

### Mode 1: Generate New Intake (Default)
When invoked with `/intake-wizard <project-description> [--interactive] [--guidance "text"] [intake-directory]`:

1. **Analyze** the user's project description
2. **Process guidance** from user prompt (if provided) to focus analysis or clarify context
3. **Ask** up to 10 clarifying questions (if --interactive mode)
4. **Infer** missing details using expert judgment
5. **Generate** complete intake forms in `.aiwg/intake/` (or specified directory)

**Default Output**: `.aiwg/intake/` (creates directory if needed)

### Mode 2: Complete Existing Intake
When invoked with `/intake-wizard --complete [--interactive] [intake-directory]`:

1. **Read** existing intake files (project-intake.md, solution-profile.md, option-matrix.md)
2. **Detect gaps** - identify missing or placeholder fields
3. **Auto-complete** if sufficient detail exists (no questions needed)
4. **Ask questions** (up to 10) if critical gaps exist and --interactive mode enabled
5. **Update** intake files with completed information, preserving existing content

## Input Modes

### Quick Mode (Default - Generate)
User provides project description, you generate complete intake forms using best-practice defaults.

**Example**:
```
/intake-wizard "Build a customer dashboard for viewing order history and tracking shipments"
```

### Interactive Mode (Generate)
Ask 5-10 targeted questions to clarify critical decisions, adapting based on user responses.

**Example**:
```
/intake-wizard "Build a customer dashboard" --interactive
```

### Guidance Parameter
The `--guidance` parameter accepts free-form text to help tailor the intake generation. Use it for:

**Business Context**:
```bash
/intake-wizard "Build a customer portal" --guidance "B2B SaaS for healthcare, HIPAA compliance critical, 50k users"
```

**Project Constraints**:
```bash
/intake-wizard "Build mobile app backend" --guidance "Tight 3-month deadline, limited budget, team of 2 developers"
```

**Strategic Goals**:
```bash
/intake-wizard "Modernize legacy system" --guidance "Preparing for Series A fundraising, need SOC2 compliance, phased migration required"
```

**Domain-Specific Requirements**:
```bash
/intake-wizard "E-commerce platform" --guidance "Fintech app, PCI-DSS required, multi-currency support, 10+ payment gateways"
```

**Combination with Interactive**:
```bash
/intake-wizard "Customer analytics dashboard" --interactive --guidance "Real-time data processing, 100k events/sec, enterprise clients"
```

**How guidance influences generation**:
- **Prioritizes** specific areas (security, compliance, scale, performance) in generated intake
- **Infers** missing information based on context (e.g., "healthcare" → check HIPAA requirements)
- **Adjusts** profile recommendations (e.g., "compliance critical" → favor Production/Enterprise profile)
- **Tailors** questions (if --interactive, asks about guidance-specific topics first)
- **Documents** in "Problem and Outcomes" section (captures business context and drivers)
- **Sets priority weights** in option-matrix based on guidance (e.g., "tight deadline" → higher speed weight)

### Complete Mode (Auto-complete Existing)
Read existing intake files and complete any gaps automatically if enough detail exists.

**Example**:
```
/intake-wizard --complete

# Reads .aiwg/intake/*.md files
# If sufficient detail: completes automatically
# If critical gaps: reports what's needed
```

### Complete Mode + Interactive (Fill Gaps with Questions)
Read existing intake files, detect gaps, and ask questions to fill critical missing information.

**Example**:
```
/intake-wizard --complete --interactive

# Reads .aiwg/intake/*.md files
# Detects gaps: missing timeline, unclear security requirements, no scale estimate
# Asks 3-5 questions to clarify gaps
# Updates intake files with completed information
```

## Guidance Processing (If Provided)

If user provided `--guidance "text"`, parse and apply throughout intake generation.

**Extract from guidance**:
- **Business domain** (healthcare, fintech, e-commerce, enterprise, consumer)
- **Compliance requirements** (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOX, FedRAMP, SOC2)
- **Scale indicators** (user count, transaction volume, geographic distribution)
- **Timeline constraints** (tight deadline, phased rollout, MVP first)
- **Budget constraints** (cost-conscious, enterprise budget, startup)
- **Team characteristics** (size, experience level, tech stack familiarity)
- **Strategic drivers** (fundraising, audit prep, market expansion, modernization)

**Apply guidance to**:
1. **Profile recommendation**: Weight criteria based on guidance (e.g., "HIPAA" → Enterprise profile)
2. **Priority weights**: Adjust option-matrix weights (e.g., "tight deadline" → Speed 0.5)
3. **Security posture**: Elevate based on compliance (e.g., "PCI-DSS" → Strong security)
4. **Interactive questions**: Focus on guidance-specific gaps (if --interactive)
5. **Documentation**: Reference guidance in intake forms (Problem statement, constraints)

**Example guidance processing**:

Input: `--guidance "B2B SaaS for healthcare, HIPAA compliance critical, 50k users, preparing for SOC2 audit"`

Extracted:
- Domain: Healthcare (B2B SaaS)
- Compliance: HIPAA (critical), SOC2 (in progress)
- Scale: 50k users (Production profile likely)
- Intent: Audit preparation

Applied:
- Profile: Production (compliance + established users)
- Security: Strong (HIPAA + SOC2 mandatory)
- Priority weights: Quality 0.4, Reliability 0.3, Speed 0.2, Cost 0.1
- Questions (if --interactive): Focus on HIPAA controls, audit timeline, PHI handling
- Documentation: Capture in "Problem and Outcomes" → "SOC2 audit preparation for healthcare SaaS"

## Question Strategy (Interactive Mode Only)

### Core Principles
- **Maximum 10 questions total** - be selective and strategic
- **Adapt dynamically** - adjust questions based on previous answers AND guidance
- **Match technical level** - gauge user expertise and adjust complexity
- **Focus on decisions** - ask about trade-offs that significantly impact architecture
- **Fill gaps intelligently** - use expert judgment when user lacks technical knowledge
- **Leverage guidance** - skip questions already answered by guidance, focus on remaining gaps

### Question Categories (Priority Order)

#### 1. Problem Clarity (1-2 questions)
**Ask if**: Problem statement is vague or missing success criteria

**Questions**:
- "What specific problem are you solving? What's broken or inefficient today?"
- "How will you measure success? What metrics matter most?"

**Adaptive Logic**:
- If user provides clear business metrics (revenue, conversion, latency) → skip to scope questions
- If user is vague → ask simpler outcome-focused question: "What does 'better' look like for users?"

#### 2. Scope Boundaries (1-2 questions)
**Ask if**: Scope seems large or unbounded

**Questions**:
- "What's the minimum viable version? What can wait for later iterations?"
- "Are there any features that are explicitly out of scope for this phase?"

**Adaptive Logic**:
- If user mentions MVP or timeline pressure → ask about must-have vs nice-to-have features
- If user describes comprehensive solution → ask about phased rollout

#### 3. Users and Scale (1 question)
**Ask if**: User base or scale is unclear

**Questions**:
- "Who are the primary users? How many users do you expect initially and in 6 months?"

**Adaptive Logic**:
- If user says "internal team" → assume <100 users, skip detailed scale questions
- If user says "customers" or "public" → ask about expected growth trajectory

#### 4. Security and Compliance (1-2 questions)
**Ask if**: Data sensitivity or compliance requirements unclear

**Questions**:
- "What type of data will this handle? Any personal information (PII), health data (PHI), or payment information?"
- "Are there specific compliance requirements? (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)"

**Adaptive Logic**:
- If user mentions "customer data" or "users" → ask about PII/privacy
- If user mentions "healthcare", "finance", "EU users" → ask about compliance
- If user is uncertain → provide simple classification: "Would this data be public, internal-only, or confidential?"

#### 5. Infrastructure and Deployment (1-2 questions)
**Ask if**: Deployment model unclear or could significantly impact architecture

**Questions**:
- "Where will this run? (Cloud provider preference, on-premises, hybrid?)"
- "Any existing systems or APIs this needs to integrate with?"

**Adaptive Logic**:
- If user mentions specific cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) → use that, skip infrastructure questions
- If user is uncertain → ask: "Do you have a preference for managed services vs custom infrastructure?"
- If user lacks technical depth → default to managed cloud services

#### 6. Team and Timeline (1 question)
**Ask if**: Delivery expectations unclear

**Questions**:
- "What's your target timeline? When do you need this in production?"

**Adaptive Logic**:
- If user says "ASAP" or "urgent" → set speed priority high, suggest MVP approach
- If user says "6+ months" → allow for more comprehensive quality/security controls

#### 7. Technical Preferences (0-2 questions)
**Only ask if**: User demonstrates technical knowledge or has strong preferences

**Questions**:
- "Do you have preferred languages or frameworks your team knows well?"
- "Any architectural preferences? (monolith, microservices, serverless?)"

**Adaptive Logic**:
- If user uses technical jargon confidently → ask about architecture preferences
- If user is non-technical → skip entirely, choose based on team size and scale
- If user mentions existing tech stack → align with it for maintainability

### Example Question Flow

**Scenario**: User says "Build a customer dashboard"

**Question 1** (Problem Clarity):
> "What specific problem are you solving with this dashboard? What's missing or inefficient today?"

**User Response**: "Customers call support to check order status. We get 50+ calls daily."

**Question 2** (Success Metrics - adaptive):
> "Got it - reducing support calls. What would success look like? 50% fewer calls? Specific metrics?"

**User Response**: "If we can cut calls in half within 3 months, that's a win."

**Question 3** (Scope - adaptive):
> "For the first version, what's absolutely essential? Just order status, or also tracking, history, returns?"

**User Response**: "Order status and basic tracking. History and returns can wait."

**Question 4** (Users & Scale):
> "How many customers will use this? Current count and expected in 6 months?"

**User Response**: "About 5,000 active customers now, maybe 10,000 in 6 months."

**Question 5** (Data & Security - adaptive based on "customers"):
> "Will this show personal info like addresses or payment details? Any privacy/compliance concerns?"

**User Response**: "Just addresses for shipping tracking. We're in EU so GDPR applies."

**Question 6** (Timeline):
> "What's your target timeline to get this live?"

**User Response**: "3 months to launch."

**Question 7** (Infrastructure - skipped, user non-technical):
*Agent decides*: User is non-technical, default to managed cloud (AWS/Vercel for simplicity)

**Question 8** (Team - optional):
> "What's your team size and tech experience?"

**User Response**: "Just me and one developer. We know React and Node."

**Stop at 8 questions** - have enough information to generate complete intake.

**Expert Inferences Made**:
- Architecture: Simple monolith (team of 2, moderate scale)
- Cloud: AWS with managed services (non-technical, tight timeline)
- Security: Baseline + GDPR compliance (EU customers)
- Profile: MVP (3-month timeline, clear scope reduction)
- Reliability: p95 < 1s, 99% uptime (customer-facing, moderate scale)

## Attachments

- Solution profile: `.aiwg/intake/solution-profile.md`
- Option matrix: `.aiwg/intake/option-matrix.md`

## Next Steps

**Your intake documents are now complete and ready for the next phase!**

1. **Review** generated intake files for accuracy
2. **Proceed directly to Inception** using natural language or explicit commands:
   - Natural language: "Start Inception" or "Let's transition to Inception"
   - Explicit command: `/flow-concept-to-inception .`

**Note**: You do NOT need to run `/intake-start` - that command is only for teams who manually created their own intake documents. The `intake-wizard` and `intake-from-codebase` commands produce validated intake ready for immediate use
```

#### 2. solution-profile.md

```markdown
# Solution Profile

**Document Type**: {Greenfield Project Profile | Existing System Profile}
**Generated**: {current date}

## Profile Selection

**Profile**: {Prototype | MVP | Production | Enterprise}

**Selection Logic** (automated based on inputs):
- **Prototype**: Timeline <4 weeks, no external users, experimental/learning, high uncertainty
- **MVP**: Timeline 1-3 months, initial users (internal or limited beta), proving viability
- **Production**: Timeline 3-6 months, established users, revenue-generating or critical operations
- **Enterprise**: Compliance requirements (HIPAA/SOC2/PCI-DSS), >10k users, mission-critical, contracts/SLAs

**Chosen**: {profile} - **Rationale**: {specific reasons based on timeline, user count, compliance, criticality}

Example rationales:
- "MVP: 3-month timeline, 50 internal users for beta testing, validating before public launch"
- "Production: GDPR compliance required (EU customers), 5k established users, revenue-critical"
- "Enterprise: HIPAA + SOC2 compliance, 50k users, 99.99% uptime SLA, mission-critical healthcare app"

## Profile Characteristics

### Security

**Posture**: {Minimal | Baseline | Strong | Enterprise} - based on data classification and compliance

**Profile Defaults**:
- **Prototype/MVP**: Baseline (user auth, environment secrets, HTTPS, basic logging)
- **Production**: Strong (threat model, SAST/DAST, secrets manager, audit logs, incident response)
- **Enterprise**: Enterprise (full SDL, penetration testing, compliance controls, SOC2/ISO27001, IR playbooks)

**Chosen**: {specific posture} - **Rationale**: {data sensitivity, compliance requirements, user trust needs}

**Controls Included**:

- **Production**: Requirements (user stories/use cases), SAD, ADRs, test strategy, deployment plan, runbook
- **Enterprise**: Full template suite (requirements, architecture, test, security, deployment, governance)

**Tailoring Notes**: {customizations based on team/context}
- Example: "Production profile but lightweight process due to small team (2 devs) - skip governance templates"
- Example: "MVP profile but add ADRs early due to expected refactoring"

## Improvement Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Immediate - First Sprint)**:
{critical setup for chosen profile}
- **Prototype**: Git repo, README, basic deployment script
- **MVP**: Git + feature branches, CI with linting, basic tests, README
- **Production**: Full CI/CD, monitoring, basic runbook, 30%+ test coverage
- **Enterprise**: All Production + security scanning, audit logging, compliance controls

**Recommended Actions** (specific to this project):
1. {Action 1 based on profile gaps}
2. {Action 2 based on profile gaps}
3. {Action 3 based on profile gaps}

**Phase 2 (Short-term - First 3 Months)**:
{build toward target state}
- **Prototype → MVP**: Add tests (30%), structured logging, basic monitoring
- **MVP → Production**: Increase tests (60%), add APM, create runbooks, incident response plan
- **Production → Enterprise**: Compliance controls, penetration testing, disaster recovery plan

**Recommended Actions** (if project succeeds and scales):
1. {Scaling action 1}
2. {Scaling action 2}
3. {Scaling action 3}

**Phase 3 (Long-term - 6-12 Months)**:
{mature to next profile level if needed}
- **Growth triggers**: {when to level up: user count, revenue, compliance requirements, team size}
- **Leveling up**: {what changes when moving to next profile}

## Overrides and Customizations

**Security Overrides**: {if different from profile defaults}
- Example: "MVP profile but Strong security due to PII" → Add: encryption at rest, secrets manager, audit logs

**Reliability Overrides**: {if different from profile defaults}
- Example: "Production profile but 99.5% OK (not 99.9%) due to internal tool" → Relaxed monitoring

**Testing Overrides**: {if different from profile defaults}
- Example: "Production profile but 40% coverage acceptable (tight timeline, will increase post-launch)"

**Process Overrides**: {if different from profile defaults}
- Example: "Enterprise profile but skip governance templates (small team, pre-compliance phase)"

**Rationale for Overrides**: {explain why deviating from defaults}
- {Justification for each override, with triggers for revisiting}

## Key Decisions

**Decision #1: Profile Selection**
- **Chosen**: {profile}
- **Alternative Considered**: {next closest profile}
- **Rationale**: {why chosen over alternative}
- **Revisit Trigger**: {when to consider upgrading profile}

**Decision #2: Security Posture**
- **Chosen**: {posture level}
- **Alternative Considered**: {higher or lower level}
- **Rationale**: {data sensitivity, compliance, cost/time trade-offs}
- **Revisit Trigger**: {when to upgrade security}

**Decision #3: Test Coverage Target**
- **Chosen**: {percentage}
- **Alternative Considered**: {higher or lower}
- **Rationale**: {quality vs. speed trade-off, team capacity, risk tolerance}
- **Revisit Trigger**: {when to increase coverage}

## Next Steps

1. Review profile selection and customizations
2. Validate that security/reliability/testing targets align with priorities from `option-matrix.md`
3. Ensure process rigor matches team size and coordination needs
4. Start Inception with profile-appropriate templates and agents
5. Revisit profile selection at phase transitions (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition)

---

## Step 3: Priorities & Trade-offs

**INTERACTIVE SECTION** - Allocate 6-8 of 10 questions here if --interactive mode.

### What Matters Most?

**Rank these priorities** (1 = most important, 4 = least important):

From user responses or inferred from project characteristics:
- {rank} - Speed to delivery (launch fast, iterate quickly)
- {rank} - Cost efficiency (minimize time/money spent)
- {rank} - Quality & security (build it right, avoid issues)
- {rank} - Reliability & scale (handle growth, stay available)

**Priority Weights** (must sum to 1.0, derived from ranking + questions):

| Criterion | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Delivery speed** | {0.10-0.50} | {Based on timeline pressure, competitive urgency, learning goals} |
| **Cost efficiency** | {0.10-0.40} | {Based on budget constraints, resource limitations, startup/enterprise} |
| **Quality/security** | {0.10-0.50} | {Based on data sensitivity, compliance, user trust needs} |
| **Reliability/scale** | {0.10-0.40} | {Based on user base size, uptime needs, growth plans} |
| **TOTAL** | **1.00** | ← Must sum to 1.0 |

Example weights:
- MVP/Startup: Speed 0.4, Cost 0.3, Quality 0.2, Reliability 0.1
- Production: Speed 0.2, Cost 0.2, Quality 0.3, Reliability 0.3
- Enterprise: Speed 0.1, Cost 0.2, Quality 0.4, Reliability 0.3

### Trade-off Context

**What are you optimizing for?** (from user or inferred):
```
{Capture user's priorities in their words or infer from context}

Example: "Fast time-to-market to validate product-market fit before investing in scalable architecture. Can refactor later if users adopt."
```

**What are you willing to sacrifice?** (from user or inferred):
```
{Capture explicit trade-offs}

Example: "Skip comprehensive tests initially (30% coverage OK), manual deployment acceptable for MVP, can add automation post-launch."
```

**What is non-negotiable?** (from user or inferred):
```
{Capture absolute constraints}

Example: "GDPR compliance non-negotiable (EU customers). Data encryption and deletion APIs must be day-one features."
```

---

## Step 4: Intent & Decision Context

**INTERACTIVE SECTION** - Allocate 2-3 of 10 questions here if --interactive.

### Why This Intake Now?

**What triggered this intake?** (from user or inferred):
- {[x] if applicable} Starting new project (need to plan approach)
- {[x] if applicable} Seeking SDLC structure (want organized process)
- {[x] if applicable} Team alignment (multiple stakeholders need shared understanding)
- {[x] if applicable} Funding/business milestone (investor pitch, customer demo)

**What decisions need making?** (from user or inferred):
```
{Capture key decisions requiring intake clarity}

Example: "Choose between monolith (fast) vs microservices (scalable). Need data to justify trade-off to CTO."
```

**What's uncertain or controversial?** (from user if provided):
```
{Capture disagreements or unknowns}

Example: "Team split on React vs Vue. Need objective criteria (team skills, ecosystem, hiring) to decide."
```

**Success criteria for this intake process** (from user or defaults):
```
{What makes intake valuable?}

Example: "Clear technical direction, stakeholder alignment on priorities, realistic timeline and scope, ready to start development."
```

---

## Step 5: Framework Application

**INTERACTIVE SECTION** - Allocate 1-2 of 10 questions here if --interactive.

### Relevant SDLC Components

Based on project reality (Step 1) and priorities (Step 3), which framework components are relevant?

**Templates** (check applicable):
- [x] Intake (project-intake, solution-profile, option-matrix) - **Always include**
- {[x] if applicable} Requirements (user-stories, use-cases, NFRs) - Include if: {team >1, complex domain, multiple stakeholders}
- {[x] if applicable} Architecture (SAD, ADRs, API contracts) - Include if: {multi-service, >10k LoC estimated, team >3}
- {[x] if applicable} Test (test-strategy, test-plan, test-cases) - Include if: {Production+ profile, >1 developer, compliance}
- {[x] if applicable} Security (threat-model, security-requirements) - Include if: {PII, payments, compliance, external users}
- {[x] if applicable} Deployment (deployment-plan, runbook, ORR) - Include if: {Production+ profile, >10 users, SLA}
- {[x] if applicable} Governance (decision-log, CCB-minutes, RACI) - Include if: {team >5, multiple stakeholders, enterprise}

**Commands** (check applicable):
- [x] Intake commands (intake-wizard, intake-start) - **Always include**
- {[x] if applicable} Flow commands (/flow-iteration-dual-track, /flow-discovery-track, /flow-delivery-track) - Include if: {team >1, iterative development}
- {[x] if applicable} Quality gates (/security-gate, /gate-check) - Include if: {compliance, Production+ profile}
- {[x] if applicable} Specialized (/build-poc, /pr-review, /create-prd) - Include if: {specific needs from requirements}

**Agents** (check applicable):
- {[x] if applicable} Core SDLC agents (requirements-analyst, architect, code-reviewer, test-engineer, devops-engineer) - Include if: {team >1, MVP+ profile}
- {[x] if applicable} Security specialists (security-gatekeeper, security-auditor) - Include if: {PII, compliance, Production+ profile}
- {[x] if applicable} Operations specialists (incident-responder, reliability-engineer) - Include if: {Production+ profile, SLA, >100 users}
- {[x] if applicable} Enterprise specialists (legal-liaison, compliance-validator, privacy-officer) - Include if: {Enterprise profile, contracts, compliance}

**Process Rigor Level** (select based on profile):
- {[x] if applicable} Minimal (README, lightweight notes) - For: Prototype (solo, <4 weeks, experimental)
- {[x] if applicable} Moderate (user stories, basic architecture, test plan) - For: MVP (small team, 1-3 months, proving viability)
- {[x] if applicable} Full (comprehensive docs, traceability, gates) - For: Production (established users, compliance, mission-critical)
- {[x] if applicable} Enterprise (audit trails, compliance evidence, change control) - For: Enterprise (contracts, >10k users, regulated)

### Rationale for Framework Choices

**Why this subset of framework?** (based on analysis):
```
{Explain which components are relevant and why}

Example:
"MVP project (3-month timeline, 50 beta users) needs Moderate rigor:
- Intake (establish baseline, align team)
- Requirements (user stories for 2-person team coordination)
- Architecture (basic SAD, ADRs for refactoring decisions expected)
- Test (30% coverage target, smoke tests for critical paths)
- Skip security templates (Baseline posture sufficient, no compliance yet)
- Skip governance (team of 2, informal communication OK)
- Core SDLC agents (requirements-analyst, architect, code-reviewer, test-engineer)
- Flow commands (/flow-iteration-dual-track for 2-week sprints)"
```

**What we're skipping and why** (be explicit):
```
{List unused framework components with justification}

Example:
"Skipping enterprise templates because:
- No compliance requirements (no HIPAA/PCI-DSS/SOC2)
- Small team (2 developers, no coordination overhead)
- MVP timeline (3 months, lightweight process priority)
- Internal beta users (no contracts, no SLA)

Will revisit if: beta succeeds → production launch, compliance requirements emerge, team expands >5 people."
```

---

## Step 6: Evolution & Adaptation

**INTERACTIVE SECTION** - Allocate 1-2 of 10 questions here if --interactive.

### Expected Changes

**How might this project evolve?** (from user or inferred):
- {[x] if applicable} User base growth (when: {timeline}, trigger: {event})
- {[x] if applicable} Feature expansion (when: {timeline}, trigger: {event})
- {[x] if applicable} Team expansion (when: {timeline}, trigger: {event})
- {[x] if applicable} Commercial/monetization (when: {timeline}, trigger: {event})
- {[x] if applicable} Compliance requirements (when: {timeline}, trigger: {event})
- {[x] if applicable} Technical pivot (when: {timeline}, trigger: {event})

**Adaptation Triggers** (when to revisit framework application):
```
{What events would require more structure?}

Example:
"Add security templates when PII introduced (user accounts planned for month 4).
Add governance templates when team exceeds 5 people (hiring planned post-Series A).
Upgrade to Production profile when beta ends (timeline: month 6, trigger: 500+ active users)."
```

**Planned Framework Evolution** (from analysis):
- **Current (Inception)**: {list components from Step 5}
- **3 months (Elaboration)**: {add if growth/validation occurs}
- **6 months (Construction)**: {add if assumptions validated, scale increases}
- **12 months (Transition)**: {add if production launch, compliance, team scaling}

## Architectural Options Analysis

### Option A: {Architecture 1 Name}

**Description**: {brief overview of architectural approach}

**Technology Stack**: {specific technologies}

**Scoring** (0-5 scale):
| Criterion | Score | Rationale |

**Rationale**: {explain why this option best fits priorities from Step 3}

**Sensitivities**:
- If timeline pressure increases → consider {speed-optimized option}
- If compliance requirements added → reconsider {quality-optimized option}
- If scale projections exceed 50k users → reevaluate {scale-optimized option}

**Implementation Plan**:
1. {First step for chosen option}
2. {Second step}
3. {Third step}

**Risks and Mitigations**:

2. Confirm chosen architectural option with technical leads
3. Use recommended framework components from Step 5 for Inception phase
4. Start Inception flow: `/intake-start .aiwg/intake/`
5. Revisit framework selection at phase gates (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition)
```

- PHI/PCI: Strong (threat model, SAST/DAST, compliance controls)
- Regulated industry: Enterprise (full SDL, audit logs, IR playbooks)

### Compliance by Region/Industry
- EU users: GDPR (data privacy, consent, deletion rights)
- US healthcare: HIPAA (PHI protection, audit logs)
- US finance: PCI-DSS (payment security)
- None mentioned: Standard best practices

### Cloud Provider Defaults
- User mentioned AWS/Azure/GCP: Use that
- Small team, fast timeline: AWS (broadest managed services)
- Microsoft shop: Azure

- Production: Speed 0.2, Cost 0.2, Quality 0.3, Reliability 0.3
- Enterprise: Speed 0.1, Cost 0.2, Quality 0.4, Reliability 0.3

## Complete Mode Workflow

### Step 1: Read Existing Intake Files

Read files in priority order:
```bash
# Check for intake files
ls .aiwg/intake/project-intake.md
ls .aiwg/intake/solution-profile.md
ls .aiwg/intake/option-matrix.md

# If not found, try alternate locations
ls ./project-intake.md
ls ./solution-profile.md
ls ./option-matrix.md
```

**If files don't exist**:
- Report: "No existing intake files found. Use without --complete to generate new intake."
- Exit with error

**If files exist**: Continue to gap detection

### Step 2: Parse and Analyze Existing Content

For each file, identify:

**Placeholder Patterns** (indicate missing content):
- `{placeholder}` or `{TBD}` or `{TODO}`
- `name` or `contact` (template placeholders)
- `bullets` or `list` or `notes`
- `e.g., ...` without actual value
- `YYYY-MM-DD` without actual date
- Empty bullet points: `- `
- Field with no value after colon: `- Field:`

**Vague Content** (needs clarification):
- "TBD", "To be determined", "Unknown"
- "Small", "Medium", "Large" without numbers
- "Soon", "Later", "Eventually" without timeline
- "Some", "A few", "Several" without specifics

**Sufficient Content** (acceptable as-is):
- Specific numbers: "5,000 users", "3 months", "$50k budget"
- Named entities: "AWS", "React + Node", "PostgreSQL"
- Dates: "2025-12-31", "Q2 2025"
- Enumerations: "Customer Support, Engineering, Product"

### Step 3: Gap Classification

Classify each gap by criticality:

**Critical Gaps** (blocks Inception phase):
- Problem statement missing or vague
- No timeline/timeframe
- No scope definition (in-scope items)
- No security classification
- No profile selection (solution-profile.md)
- Missing all options (option-matrix.md)

**Important Gaps** (should fill, can infer if needed):
- Success metrics unclear
- Stakeholders incomplete
- Team size unknown
- Scale expectations missing
- Compliance requirements unclear

**Minor Gaps** (can infer with high confidence):
- Specific dates (use current date + timeline)
- Budget (infer from scale and profile)
- Operational support details
- Technical preferences
- Observability level

### Step 4: Auto-Complete Decision

**If zero critical gaps** AND **≤3 important gaps**:
- Auto-complete mode: Fill all gaps using expert inference
- No questions needed
- Preserve ALL existing content
- Only add missing values

**If 1+ critical gaps** OR **>3 important gaps**:
- **If --interactive flag present**: Ask questions to fill critical and important gaps (max 10)
- **If no --interactive flag**: Report gaps and suggest re-running with --interactive
  ```
  Found 2 critical gaps and 4 important gaps:

  Critical:
  - Timeline/timeframe not specified
  - Security classification missing

  Important:
  - Success metrics vague ("improve efficiency")
  - Scale expectations unclear
  - Team size unknown
  - Compliance requirements not mentioned

  Recommendation: Run with --interactive to clarify:
  /intake-wizard --complete --interactive
  ```

### Step 5: Gap-Focused Questioning (Complete + Interactive)

**Prioritize questions by gap criticality**:

1. **Critical gaps first** (always ask):
   - Missing timeline → "What's your target timeline for this project?"
   - Missing scope → "What are the must-have features for the first version?"
   - Missing security → "What type of data will this handle? Any PII or sensitive information?"

2. **Important gaps second** (ask if <10 questions total):
   - Vague metrics → "How will you measure success? What specific metrics matter?"
   - Missing scale → "How many users do you expect initially and in 6 months?"
   - Unknown team → "What's your team size and technical experience?"

3. **Minor gaps** (infer, don't ask):
   - Use expert judgment based on other provided information

**Example Gap-Focused Flow**:

Existing intake has:
- Project name: "Customer Portal" ✓
- Problem: "Customers can't see order status" ✓
- Timeline: `{timeframe}` ✗ CRITICAL GAP
- In-scope: "Order status, tracking" ✓
- Security: `{classification}` ✗ CRITICAL GAP
- Scale: "customers" (vague) ✗ IMPORTANT GAP
- Team: `{notes}` ✗ IMPORTANT GAP

**Questions (4 total, under 10 limit)**:
1. "What's your target timeline to get this live?" (CRITICAL)
2. "What type of data will customers see? Any personal info like addresses or payment details?" (CRITICAL)
3. "How many customers will use this? Current count and 6-month projection?" (IMPORTANT)
4. "What's your team size and tech stack experience?" (IMPORTANT)

**Auto-infer** (no questions):
- Success metrics: "80% customer self-service", "50% reduction in support calls"
- Stakeholders: Customer Support, Engineering, Product
- Budget: $500-1000/mo based on scale
- Profile: MVP (3-month timeline, modest scale)

### Step 6: Update Files (Preserve Existing Content)

**Merge Strategy**:
- **Keep all existing non-placeholder content**
- **Replace placeholders** with actual values
- **Enhance vague content** with specifics
- **Add missing sections** if entirely absent
- **Preserve formatting** and structure

**Example Update**:

**Before (project-intake.md)**:
```markdown
- Project name: Customer Portal
- Requestor/owner: `name/contact`
- Date: `YYYY-MM-DD`

## Problem and Outcomes

- Problem statement: Customers can't see order status online
- Target personas/scenarios: `bullets`
- Success metrics (KPIs): `e.g., activation +20%, p95 < 200ms`

## Scope and Constraints

- In-scope: Order status, tracking
- Out-of-scope (for now): `bullets`
- Timeframe: `e.g., MVP in 6 weeks`
```

**After (completed)**:
```markdown
- Project name: Customer Portal
- Requestor/owner: Engineering Team
- Date: 2025-10-15

## Problem and Outcomes

- Problem statement: Customers can't see order status online, resulting in 50+ daily support calls
- Target personas/scenarios: Existing customers checking order status and shipment tracking
- Success metrics (KPIs): 50% reduction in support calls within 3 months, 80% customer self-service rate, p95 latency < 500ms

## Scope and Constraints

- In-scope: Order status, tracking
- Out-of-scope (for now): Order history (full purchase history), Returns processing, Refund requests
- Timeframe: MVP in 12 weeks (3 months)
```

**Changes Made**:
- Filled `name/contact` → "Engineering Team" (inferred)
- Filled `YYYY-MM-DD` → "2025-10-15" (current date)
- Enhanced problem statement with context from user answers
- Filled `bullets` for personas → specific personas based on problem
- Replaced vague metrics with specific KPIs from user answers
- Filled out-of-scope bullets → inferred complementary features
- Filled timeframe → from user answer "3 months"

### Step 7: Generate Completion Report

Auto-completing intake files...

✓ Updated .aiwg/intake/project-intake.md (8 fields filled)
✓ Updated .aiwg/intake/solution-profile.md (2 fields filled)
✓ Created .aiwg/intake/option-matrix.md (complete)

Inferences made:
- Security: Baseline (internal tool, no PII, HR data is Internal classification)
- Scale: <100 users (internal HR tool)
- Profile: MVP (10-week timeline, internal validation)
- Architecture: Simple monolith (small team, internal scale)
- Priority weights: Speed 0.4, Cost 0.3, Quality 0.3 (MVP focus)

All intake files complete. Ready for Inception phase.
```

### Example 2: Interactive Completion (Questions for Critical Gaps)

**Existing .aiwg/intake/project-intake.md** (partial):
```markdown
- Project name: Mobile API
- Problem statement: Mobile app needs backend
- In-scope: `bullets`
- Timeframe: `e.g., MVP in 6 weeks`
- Security posture: `{classification}`
```

**Command**:
```
/intake-wizard --complete --interactive
```

**Agent Analysis**:
- Critical gaps: 3 (scope, timeline, security all missing)
- Important gaps: many

**Agent Response**:
```
Reading existing intake files...

✓ Found: .aiwg/intake/project-intake.md
✓ Found: .aiwg/intake/solution-profile.md
✓ Found: .aiwg/intake/option-matrix.md

Analyzing gaps...

Found 3 critical gaps and 5 important gaps:

Critical:
- In-scope features not defined
- Timeline not specified
- Security classification missing

Important:
- Success metrics vague ("backend for mobile app")
- Scale expectations unclear
- Team size unknown
- Integrations not specified
- Compliance requirements not mentioned

I'll ask a few questions to fill the critical gaps.

Question 1/10: What specific features does the mobile API need to provide? What can the app do?

{user responds: "User login, product catalog browsing, add to cart, checkout"}

Question 2/10: What's your target timeline to get this API production-ready?

{user responds: "We need it in 4 months for the mobile app launch"}

Question 3/10: What type of data will the API handle? Any personal info, payment data, or health information?

{user responds: "Yes - user profiles, shipping addresses, and credit card processing"}

Question 4/10: How many users do you expect? Initial launch and 6-month projection?

{user responds: "Launching to 10k existing customers, expecting 25k in 6 months"}

Question 5/10: Any specific compliance requirements given you're handling payment data?

{user responds: "We're in the US and EU, so PCI-DSS for payments and GDPR for EU users"}

Great! I have what I need. Completing your intake files...

✓ Updated .aiwg/intake/project-intake.md
✓ Updated .aiwg/intake/solution-profile.md
✓ Updated .aiwg/intake/option-matrix.md

Summary:
- In-scope: User auth, product catalog API, cart management, checkout/payment
- Timeline: 16 weeks (4 months)
- Security: Strong (PCI-DSS + GDPR compliance required)
- Scale: 10k launch, 25k in 6 months
- Profile: Production (compliance requirements, revenue-generating)
- Architecture: Service-oriented (moderate scale, payment isolation)

All critical gaps filled. Ready for Inception phase.
```

## Interactive Mode Example

**User Input**:
```
/intake-wizard "Build an API for our mobile app to fetch product catalog and process orders" --interactive
```

**Agent Response**:
```
I'll help you create complete intake forms for your API project. Let me ask a few key questions to get the details right.

Question 1/10: What specific problem does this API solve? What's inefficient or broken today?

{wait for user response}

{adapt questions 2-10 based on responses, maximum 10 total}

{after questions complete}

Great! I have everything I need. Generating your complete intake forms...

✓ Created .aiwg/intake/project-intake.md
✓ Created .aiwg/intake/solution-profile.md
✓ Created .aiwg/intake/option-matrix.md

Summary:
- Project: Product Catalog & Order API
- Profile: Production (compliance requirements, established users)
- Architecture: Microservices (scale >10k users)
- Timeline: 16 weeks to production
- Compliance: GDPR + PCI-DSS

Next steps:
1. Review the generated intake forms
2. Start Inception flow: /flow-concept-to-inception .

## Quality Checklist

Before generating files, ensure:

- [ ] **No placeholders**: Every field has a real value, not `{TBD}` or `{TODO}`
- [ ] **No contradictions**: Timeline matches scope, security matches data sensitivity
- [ ] **Realistic metrics**: Success metrics are measurable and achievable
- [ ] **Complete stakeholders**: All relevant roles identified
- [ ] **Justified architecture**: Architecture choice matches scale and team size
- [ ] **Reasonable priorities**: Priority weights sum to 1.0 and reflect project goals
- [ ] **Actionable scope**: In-scope items are specific features, out-of-scope is explicit
- [ ] **Valid compliance**: Compliance requirements match industry and region
- [ ] **Option matrix scored**: All options have scores with rationale

## Success Criteria

This command succeeds when:
- [ ] Three complete intake files generated (project-intake, solution-profile, option-matrix)
- [ ] Zero placeholder fields (all `{template}` values replaced)
- [ ] Internally consistent (no conflicting requirements)
- [ ] Actionable (team can start Inception immediately)
- [ ] If interactive: Asked ≤10 questions, adapted based on responses
- [ ] Expert inferences documented in files (rationale for defaults chosen)

## Error Handling

**Insufficient Input**:
- Report: "Project description too vague. Need at least: what you're building and who it's for."
- Action: "Please provide: 'Build a {thing} for {users} to {do-what}'"
- Example: "Build a dashboard for customers to track orders"

**Interactive Mode - User Unclear**:
- Report: "I notice you're uncertain about {topic}. Let me suggest a sensible default."
- Action: Provide 2-3 options with recommendation
- Example: "Not sure about scale? I recommend planning for 1k-5k users initially with room to scale."

**Contradictory Requirements**:
- Report: "I notice {contradiction}: {detail}"
- Action: "Resolving with: {decision} based on {rationale}"
- Example: "Timeline is 4 weeks but scope includes 15 features. Recommending MVP with 3 core features."
