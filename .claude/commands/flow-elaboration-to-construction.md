# Elaboration → Construction Phase Transition Flow

**You are the Core Orchestrator** for the critical Elaboration→Construction phase transition.

## Your Role

**You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**

When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):

1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
6. **Report completion** with summary

## Phase Transition Overview

**From**: Elaboration (architecture proven, risks retired)
**To**: Construction (full-scale iterative development)

**Key Milestone**: Construction Phase Entry

**Success Criteria**:
- Architecture baselined and stable
- First 2 iterations planned with ready backlog
- Development process tailored and team trained
- CI/CD pipeline operational
- Iteration 0 (infrastructure) complete

**Expected Duration**: 1-2 weeks setup, 15-20 minutes orchestration

## Natural Language Triggers

Users may say:
- "Transition to Construction"
- "Start Construction phase"
- "Begin building"
- "Move to Construction"
- "Scale up for Construction"
- "Start full development"

You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.

## Parameter Handling

### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor orchestration priorities

**Examples**:
```
--guidance "Team scaling from 5 to 20 developers, need extensive onboarding"
--guidance "Fast track, minimal documentation, focus on delivery"
--guidance "Offshore team joining, need extra process documentation"
--guidance "Complex integrations, need thorough environment setup"
```

**How to Apply**:
- Parse guidance for keywords: scaling, timeline, team, infrastructure
- Adjust agent assignments (add environment-engineer for complex setup)
- Modify artifact depth (comprehensive vs minimal documentation)
- Influence priority ordering (infrastructure vs process focus)

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: You ask 5-8 strategic questions to understand project context

**Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):

```
I'll ask 6 strategic questions to tailor the Construction transition to your needs:

Q1: What's your team scaling plan?
    (e.g., 5→20 developers, gradual vs immediate, onshore/offshore mix)

Q2: What are your infrastructure priorities?
    (Help me focus Iteration 0 on critical infrastructure needs)

Q3: What's your iteration cadence preference?
    (1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks - affects planning depth)

Q4: How mature is your CI/CD pipeline?
    (Determines infrastructure setup focus)

Q5: What's your biggest concern for Construction?
    (e.g., quality, velocity, team coordination, technical debt)

Q6: Do you need specialized environments?
    (e.g., compliance environments, performance testing, security scanning)

Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
- Agent assignments (infrastructure vs process focus)
- Iteration planning depth (detailed vs high-level)
- Onboarding materials (comprehensive vs minimal)
- Environment setup complexity
```

**Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Architecture Baseline Milestone (ABM)

**Purpose**: Verify Elaboration phase complete before starting Construction

**Your Actions**:

1. **Check for Required Elaboration Artifacts**:
   ```
   Read and verify presence of:
   - .aiwg/architecture/software-architecture-doc.md
   - .aiwg/architecture/adr/*.md
   - .aiwg/requirements/supplemental-specification.md
   - .aiwg/testing/master-test-plan.md
   - .aiwg/risks/risk-list.md (≥70% retired)
   ```

2. **Launch ABM Validation Agent**:
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="project-manager",
       description="Validate Architecture Baseline Milestone criteria",
       prompt="""
       Read gate criteria from: $AIWG_ROOT/agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/flows/gate-criteria-by-phase.md

       Validate ABM criteria:
       - Software Architecture Document BASELINED
       - Executable architecture baseline OPERATIONAL
       - All P0/P1 architectural risks RETIRED/MITIGATED
       - ≥70% of all risks retired or mitigated
       - Requirements baseline ESTABLISHED (≥10 use cases)
       - Master Test Plan APPROVED
       - Development Case tailored
       - Test environments OPERATIONAL

       Generate ABM Validation Report:
       - Status: PASS | FAIL
       - Criteria checklist with evidence
       - Decision: GO to Construction | NO-GO
       - Gaps (if NO-GO): List missing artifacts

       Save to: .aiwg/reports/abm-validation-report.md
       """
   )
   ```

3. **Decision Point**:
   - If ABM PASS → Continue to Step 2
   - If ABM FAIL → Report gaps, recommend extending Elaboration
   - Escalate to user for executive decision if criteria partially met

**Communicate Progress**:
```
✓ Initialized ABM validation
⏳ Validating Elaboration exit criteria...
✓ ABM Validation complete: [PASS | FAIL]

## Quality Gates

Before marking workflow complete, verify:
- [ ] All required artifacts generated and reviewed
- [ ] Infrastructure validated operational (Iteration 0)
- [ ] Team process defined and training scheduled
- [ ] First 2 iterations planned with ready backlog
- [ ] Dual-track workflow configured
- [ ] Architecture stability confirmed
- [ ] Construction readiness validated

## User Communication

**At start**: Confirm understanding and list artifacts to generate

```
Understood. I'll orchestrate the Elaboration → Construction transition.

This will generate:
- ABM Validation Report
- Iteration 0 Completion Report
- Development Process Guide
- Iteration Plans (first 2 sprints)
- Team Onboarding Guide
- Architecture Stability Report
- Construction Readiness Report

I'll coordinate multiple agents for infrastructure setup and planning.
Expected duration: 15-20 minutes.

Starting orchestration...
```

**During**: Update progress with clear indicators

```
✓ = Complete
⏳ = In progress
❌ = Error/blocked
⚠️ = Warning/attention needed
```

**At end**: Summary report with artifact locations and status

## Error Handling

**If ABM Not Met**:
```
❌ Elaboration phase incomplete - cannot proceed to Construction

Gaps identified:
- {list missing artifacts or incomplete criteria}

Recommendation: Extend Elaboration
- Complete missing artifacts
- Re-run: /flow-inception-to-elaboration

Contact Software Architect for architecture completion.
```

**If Infrastructure Not Ready**:
```
❌ Iteration 0 incomplete - infrastructure not operational

Issues:
- {list infrastructure gaps}

Actions:
1. Complete infrastructure setup
2. Validate CI/CD pipeline
3. Confirm environment access

Impact: Construction blocked until infrastructure ready.
```

**If Backlog Starved**:
```
⚠️ Backlog health: STARVED ({ratio}x capacity)

Ready backlog insufficient for smooth Construction start.

Actions:
1. Accelerate Discovery track
2. Simplify requirements for faster preparation
3. Consider starting with reduced team

Risk: Delivery team may be blocked waiting for work.
```

**If Architecture Unstable**:
```
⚠️ Architecture stability: UNSTABLE

Metrics:
- Change rate: {X}% (target <10%)
- Violations: {N}

Recommendation: Architecture review needed
- Stabilize architecture before scaling team
- Document pending decisions as ADRs
- Consider architecture refactoring in Iteration 1

Risk: Continued instability will impact Construction velocity.
```

## Success Criteria

This orchestration succeeds when:
- [ ] Architecture Baseline Milestone validated (ABM complete)
- [ ] Iteration 0 infrastructure setup COMPLETE
- [ ] Development process tailored and team trained
- [ ] First 2 iterations planned with ready backlog
- [ ] Dual-track workflow OPERATIONAL
- [ ] Architecture stability confirmed (<10% change)
- [ ] Construction Phase Readiness Report shows READY
- [ ] Complete audit trails archived

## Metrics to Track

**During orchestration, track**:
- Team scaling time: Days to onboard new members
- Infrastructure setup time: Iteration 0 completion
- Training completion rate: % of team trained
- Backlog readiness: Ratio to team capacity
- Architecture stability: % changes since ABM
- Cycle time: Transition duration (target: 1-2 weeks, orchestration: 15-20 min)
