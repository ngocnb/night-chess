# Cross-Team Synchronization Flow

**You are the Core Orchestrator** for cross-team coordination and integration alignment.

## Your Role

**You orchestrate multi-agent workflows. You do NOT execute bash scripts.**

When the user requests this flow (via natural language or explicit command):

1. **Interpret the request** and confirm understanding
2. **Read this template** as your orchestration guide
3. **Extract agent assignments** and workflow steps
4. **Launch agents via Task tool** in correct sequence
5. **Synthesize results** and finalize artifacts
6. **Report completion** with summary

## Cross-Team Sync Overview

**Purpose**: Orchestrate synchronization, dependency management, and integration planning across multiple teams working on interconnected systems.

**Key Activities**:
- Dependency mapping (team-to-team dependencies)
- Sync cadence establishment (daily, weekly)
- Blocker escalation
- Integration planning
- Cross-team demos and validation

**Expected Duration**: Initial setup 2-3 hours, ongoing syncs 1 hour weekly, orchestration 20-30 minutes

## Natural Language Triggers

Users may say:
- "Sync with {team}"
- "Coordinate teams"
- "Cross-team sync"
- "Team alignment meeting"
- "Set up team coordination"
- "Map team dependencies"
- "Establish team sync cadence"
- "Resolve cross-team blockers"

You recognize these as requests for this orchestration flow.

## Parameter Handling

### Team Parameters

**Primary inputs**:
- `team-a`: First team name (required)
- `team-b`: Second team name (required)
- `sync-frequency`: Optional frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, default: weekly)

### --guidance Parameter

**Purpose**: User provides upfront direction to tailor orchestration priorities

**Examples**:
```
--guidance "High API dependencies, need tight integration coordination"
--guidance "Teams in different time zones, prefer async communication"
--guidance "Critical launch deadline, daily sync needed for next 2 weeks"
--guidance "New teams, need extra focus on knowledge sharing and patterns"
```

**How to Apply**:
- Parse guidance for keywords: integration, timezone, deadline, knowledge
- Adjust sync frequency (daily for critical periods)
- Modify meeting structure (async-friendly for timezone issues)
- Add knowledge sharing emphasis (for new teams)

### --interactive Parameter

**Purpose**: You ask 6 strategic questions to understand team dynamics

**Questions to Ask** (if --interactive):

```
I'll ask 6 strategic questions to tailor cross-team synchronization:

Q1: What are the main integration points between teams?
    (e.g., APIs, shared databases, event streams, UI components)

Q2: How critical are the dependencies?
    (Helps determine sync frequency and escalation urgency)

Q3: What's the current blocker resolution time?
    (Helps set appropriate SLAs and escalation paths)

Q4: What are the teams' time zones and availability?
    (Influences meeting scheduling and async strategies)

Q5: What's your timeline pressure?
    (Daily sync for critical periods vs. weekly for normal pace)

Q6: What collaboration tools do teams use?
    (Slack, Teams, Jira, GitHub - affects communication setup)

Based on your answers, I'll adjust:
- Sync frequency (daily, weekly, bi-weekly)
- Meeting structure (sync vs. async emphasis)
- Escalation paths (SLAs and ownership)
- Knowledge sharing approach
```

**Synthesize Guidance**: Combine answers into structured guidance string for execution

## Artifacts to Generate

   4. Review and sign off on API contracts

   **Recommendations**:
   - Start with weekly sync, adjust based on needs
   - Focus first meetings on critical blockers
   - Document patterns from first demo
   - Review sync effectiveness after 4 weeks

**Communicate Progress**:
```
⏳ Generating status report...
✓ Cross-team sync report complete: .aiwg/reports/cross-team-sync-report.md
```

## Quality Gates

Before marking workflow complete, verify:
- [ ] Dependency map comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] All integration points have documented contracts
- [ ] Sync meeting structure agreed by both teams
- [ ] Blocker tracking system operational
- [ ] Escalation paths clear and communicated
- [ ] Knowledge sharing framework established
- [ ] First meetings/demos scheduled

## User Communication

**At start**: Confirm understanding and list deliverables

```
Understood. I'll orchestrate cross-team synchronization between {team-a} and {team-b}.

This will establish:
- Dependency mapping and integration points
- Sync meeting cadence ({frequency})
- Blocker tracking with escalation
- API contracts and change protocol
- Knowledge sharing framework

Expected duration: 20-30 minutes.

Starting orchestration...
```

**During**: Update progress with clear indicators

```
✓ = Complete
⏳ = In progress
❌ = Error/blocked
⚠️ = Warning/attention needed
```

**At end**: Summary report with status and next steps (see Step 6.2 above)

## Error Handling

**Teams Not Found**:
```
❌ Team not found in project roster

Teams specified: {team-a}, {team-b}
Missing: {team-name}

Action: Verify team names or add to project roster
Command: /team-roster add {team-name}
```

**No Architecture Available**:
```
⚠️ No architecture documentation found

Cannot automatically map dependencies without:
- Software Architecture Document
- Component diagrams
- Service definitions

Recommendation: Conduct manual dependency mapping workshop
Alternative: Create architecture first with /flow-inception-to-elaboration
```

**Time Zone Conflict**:
```
⚠️ Significant time zone difference detected

Team A: {timezone-1}
Team B: {timezone-2}
Overlap: {hours} hours

Recommendations:
1. Emphasize async communication
2. Rotate meeting times
3. Record all sync meetings
4. Use written updates heavily
```

**High Blocker Volume**:
```
⚠️ High blocker volume detected

Active blockers: {count} (threshold: 10)
P0/P1 blockers: {count}

Recommendations:
1. Increase sync frequency to daily
2. Dedicated blocker resolution session
3. Executive escalation for resource allocation
4. Consider team reorganization
```

## Success Criteria

This orchestration succeeds when:
- [ ] Dependencies fully mapped with criticality
- [ ] Integration points documented with contracts
- [ ] Sync cadence established and agreed
- [ ] First sync meeting scheduled
- [ ] Blocker tracking operational
- [ ] Escalation paths defined and communicated
- [ ] Knowledge sharing framework in place
- [ ] Both teams trained on processes

## Metrics to Track

**During orchestration, track**:
- Dependency coverage: % of components analyzed
- Integration documentation: % with contracts
- Blocker age: Average days open
- Meeting attendance: % of required attendees
- Knowledge sharing: Patterns documented

**Ongoing metrics** (post-setup):
- Blocker resolution velocity
- Integration stability (breaking changes)
- Meeting effectiveness scores
- Cross-team collaboration index
- Knowledge reuse rate

## Common Failure Modes

### Dependency Drift
**Symptoms**: Teams unaware of each other's changes, integration breaks
**Remediation**:
1. Enforce change notification protocol
2. Increase sync frequency
3. Add pre-integration testing gate
4. Review and update dependency map quarterly

### Meeting Fatigue
**Symptoms**: Attendance drops, meetings feel unproductive
**Remediation**:
1. Reduce frequency if dependencies stable
2. Shorten meeting duration
3. Focus on blockers only, move other topics async
4. Rotate facilitator to share ownership

### Blocker Stagnation
**Symptoms**: Blockers remain unresolved for weeks
**Remediation**:
1. Escalate immediately per escalation matrix
2. Assign dedicated resources
3. Executive intervention if needed
4. Consider architectural changes to reduce dependencies

### API Contract Violations
**Symptoms**: Breaking changes deployed without notice
**Remediation**:
1. Implement contract testing in CI/CD
2. Enforce change management protocol
3. Post-mortem on violation
4. Improve contract governance

### One-Way Communication
**Symptoms**: One team dominates sync, other team passive
**Remediation**:
1. Rotate meeting facilitator between teams
2. Require equal time allocation
3. Use structured agenda strictly
4. Private check-in with passive team
