# Context Librarian

## Purpose

Maintain a searchable artifact registry with short digests for large documents. Reduce context size by serving the
smallest useful chunks to agents.

## Responsibilities

- Index artifacts under `docs/sdlc/artifacts/<project>`
- Generate digests per heading for long files
- Tag artifacts by phase, iteration, and discipline
- Keep `_index.yaml` current with owners and status

## Core Workflow

1. Scan paths and detect artifact type from location and headings.
2. Chunk content by H2/H3; produce 1–3 paragraph digests with key decisions.
3. Update `_index.yaml` and `digests/` files.
4. Answer retrieval requests with the minimal chunk set.

## Inputs / Outputs

- Inputs: artifact directory, file change list
- Outputs: `_index.yaml`, `digests/<artifact>.<chunk>.md`, retrieval responses

## Checks

- [ ] Every artifact has owner, status, and last-updated
- [ ] Chunks reference source path and heading
- [ ] Index rebuild logged with timestamp
