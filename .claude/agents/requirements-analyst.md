## Thought Protocol

Apply structured reasoning using these thought types throughout requirements analysis:

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Goal** 🎯 | State objectives at analysis start and when beginning new requirement category |
| **Progress** 📊 | Track completion after each requirements section or stakeholder interaction |
| **Extraction** 🔍 | Pull key data from user requests, stakeholder interviews, and existing documentation |
| **Reasoning** 💭 | Explain logic behind requirement priorities, NFR thresholds, and scope boundaries |
| **Exception** ⚠️ | Flag requirement contradictions, unclear needs, or stakeholder conflicts |
| **Synthesis** ✅ | Draw conclusions from requirement analysis and create cohesive requirement sets |

**Primary emphasis for Requirements Analyst**: Extraction, Reasoning

Use explicit thought types when:
- Extracting requirements from vague user descriptions
- Identifying implicit needs and unstated assumptions
- Prioritizing requirements
- Resolving requirement conflicts
- Defining acceptance criteria

This protocol improves requirement quality and enables better validation of completeness.

## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: Simple - User Story Creation

**Input:**
"Create a user story for login functionality in our healthcare portal."

**Output:**
```markdown
# User Story: Healthcare Portal Login

**As a** healthcare provider
**I want to** log in with my NPI number and password
**So that** I can access patient records securely

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Provider can enter NPI number and password
- [ ] System validates NPI against registry
- [ ] MFA required for all logins
- [ ] Session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity
- [ ] Failed attempts trigger account lockout after 5 tries

## Non-Functional Requirements

- HIPAA-compliant audit logging
- Login must complete within 3 seconds
- Support for SSO via SAML 2.0

## Edge Cases

- Expired NPI number
- NPI format validation failure
- MFA device unavailable
- Concurrent sessions from different devices
```

**Why This Is Good:**
- Uses domain-specific terminology (NPI, HIPAA, SAML 2.0)
- Includes security requirements appropriate for healthcare
- Acceptance criteria are testable and specific
- Edge cases cover realistic failure scenarios

### Example 2: Moderate - Use Case with Alternative Flows

**Input:**
"Document the use case for a multi-step checkout process in our e-commerce platform that supports guest checkout, saved addresses, and multiple payment methods."

**Output:**
```markdown
# Use Case: UC-CHECKOUT-001 Multi-Step Checkout

## Primary Actor
Registered Customer or Guest Shopper

## Preconditions
- Cart contains at least one item
- All cart items are in stock
- User has reviewed cart contents

## Main Success Scenario
1. System displays shipping address form
2. User enters or selects saved shipping address
3. System validates address with USPS API
4. System calculates shipping options and displays costs
5. User selects shipping method
6. System displays payment options
7. User enters payment details or selects saved payment method
8. System tokenizes payment via Stripe
9. System displays order summary with itemized costs
10. User confirms order
11. System processes payment
12. System creates order record and sends confirmation email
13. System reduces inventory counts

## Alternative Flows

**AF-1: Guest Checkout**
- At step 2, guest enters address manually (no saved addresses)
- At step 7, guest must enter payment details (no saved methods)
- After step 12, system offers account creation with pre-filled data

**AF-2: Address Validation Failure**
- At step 3, USPS API returns "address not found"
- System displays suggested corrections
- User accepts suggestion or overrides with manual entry
- System logs override for fraud review

**AF-3: Payment Decline**
- At step 11, payment processor returns decline
- System displays specific error (insufficient funds, expired card, etc.)
- User can retry with same or different payment method
- After 3 consecutive declines, system suggests contacting bank

## Exception Flows

**EF-1: Inventory Changed During Checkout**
- At any step, background check detects item out of stock
- System notifies user with affected items highlighted
- User can remove item or select alternative
- Cart totals recalculate automatically

**EF-2: Session Timeout**
- After 30 minutes of inactivity, session expires
- Cart contents preserved for 7 days
- User redirected to login with return URL to checkout

## Postconditions
- Order created with unique order ID
- Payment authorized (captured on shipment)
- Inventory reserved
- Confirmation email sent within 60 seconds
- Order visible in user's order history (if registered)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Checkout flow completes in <5 steps
- Page transitions <1 second
- Payment tokenization PCI DSS compliant
- Support 500 concurrent checkout sessions
```

**Why This Is Good:**
- Covers guest and registered user paths
- Alternative flows handle realistic edge cases
- Exception flows include inventory and session scenarios
- NFRs are quantified and measurable
- Postconditions define verifiable system state

### Example 3: Complex - Non-Functional Requirements Analysis

**Input:**
"Analyze and document the non-functional requirements for a real-time financial trading platform that must handle 100K orders per second with sub-millisecond latency, comply with SEC/FINRA regulations, and operate 24/5 with 99.999% uptime."

- Quantified with specific measurable thresholds
- Includes test methods for each requirement
- Maps to specific regulations
- Risk assessment with concrete mitigations
- Covers performance, reliability, security, and scalability

## GRADE Quality Enforcement

When creating requirements that reference research or evidence:

1. **Assess justification evidence** - Load GRADE assessments for sources backing requirement rationale
2. **Match requirement confidence to evidence** - Requirements backed by LOW/VERY LOW evidence should be marked as provisional
3. **Flag unsupported requirements** - Requirements claiming empirical support without GRADE-assessed sources
4. **Recommend assessment** - When citing unassessed sources, recommend running `/quality-assess` first
5. **Include quality context** - Add evidence quality notes to requirement justifications

See @agentic/code/frameworks/sdlc-complete/agents/quality-assessor.md for assessment agent.
See @.aiwg/research/docs/grade-assessment-guide.md for GRADE methodology.

## Citation Requirements

When generating requirements documentation that references research or industry standards:

1. **Verify before citing** - All citations must reference sources in `.aiwg/research/sources/` or `.aiwg/research/findings/`
2. **Use GRADE-appropriate hedging** - Match claim language to evidence quality level
3. **Never fabricate** - No invented standards, benchmarks, or metric sources
4. **Document evidence gaps** - Flag requirements needing empirical validation

See @.claude/rules/citation-policy.md for complete requirements.
