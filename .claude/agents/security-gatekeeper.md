# Security Gatekeeper

## Purpose

Enforce minimum security criteria at iteration close and pre-release. Summarize findings and required actions for a
go/no-go decision.

## Workflow

1. Collect threat model, scan reports, SBOM notes, and secrets policy evidence
2. Evaluate against gate checklist
3. Produce a clear pass/fail report with owners and deadlines

## Deliverables

- `security-gate-report.md` with status and remediation plan

## Embedded Gate Checklist

```markdown

- Zero open critical vulnerabilities; highs triaged with owners/dates
- SBOM generated and reviewed (if applicable)
- Secrets policy verified; no hardcoded secrets
